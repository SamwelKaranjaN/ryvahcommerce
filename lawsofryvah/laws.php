            <div class="preamble-content">
                <p>Our objective with the Laws of Ryvah is to protect, serve, and defend this great nation; uphold the
                    values of freedom and love; and provide prosperity for all.</p>
                <p>We are compelled to pass these laws because we truly believe all people are created equal with
                    certain unalienable rights which provide life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and these
                    rights are being stripped away, robbed, and dismantled by a government that has become destructive,
                    oppressive, and tyrannical. Our government no longer serves the common welfare of the people. Our
                    government had sabotaged and eroded every constitutional right we hold sacred. The protections our
                    Constitution was designed to afford us have been subverted and in practice are ineffective.</p>
                <p>Our First Amendment grants us the right to, "petition the government for a redress of grievances."
                    The Laws of Ryvah define this redress specifically for every violation of our constitutional rights.
                    Currently we are vulnerable to having our rights severely violated with impunity, and have no
                    effective method for obtaining our just compensation. Not only do the Laws of Ryvah provide just
                    compensation, they take it one step further and prevent the violations of our rights altogether.</p>
                <p>It has proven to be futile to threaten politicians with criminal consequences for violating our
                    rights because they are fundamentally immune to judicial proceedings. It has also been proven to be
                    foolish to expect impeccable moral behavior from our politicians. The Laws of Ryvah do not have
                    these flaws.</p>
                <p>When we comprehend the Declaration of Independence, the U. S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and
                    the historical context under which they were written, we can feel the dream our founding fathers had
                    and the love they expressed for the welfare of the people – all of them. The Laws of Ryvah deliver
                    this dream and are written with this love.</p>
                <p>Let us never again be so oppressed we are forced into revolutionary war. If we do not protect the
                    rights our ancestors died to give us, then our children will die to get them back.</p>

                        <p>Law of Ryvah 1. Jury instructions shall not include the words shall, must, will, cannot, or
                            any other term that suggests the jury has an obligation to violate the defendant's rights to

                            or any other terminology that acknowledges the jury's power. Any agency that instructs a
                            jury they are obligated to follow any particular law or instruction shall pay the defendant
                            a fine of one AIPY via FPS PA.</p>
                        <div class="explanation">
                            <h4>Explanation of 1st Law – Jury Empowerment</h4>
                            <p>We wish to put an end to excessive punishment. The petty theft of a candy bar should
                                never again get life in prison. Yes, again–America was doing this. The politicians have
                                many creative ways to misuse justice and inflict ridiculously excessive punishments. At
                                first such amplifiers as repeat offenders, prison priors, gang enhancements, gun
                                enhancements, hate crime, and many more–they sound good. The idea of filing over thirty
                                charges based on thirty different crimes, also sounds good. Until you get to the jury
                                box when you realize he kissed her thirty times on the date, or there were thirty
                                pictures on his phone, or there were thirty M&M's in the bag of candy.</p>
                            <p>Further, we wish to strip power from the prosecutor and judge and give the power to the
                                jury. The penalty to the prosecutor for attempting to over punish a defendant is to
                                lose. The jury most accurately represents the people, and they are the ones who will
                                ultimately pay the expense of incarceration.</p>
                            <p>Further, we wish to directly associate punishment with the act committed and remove the
                                abstraction of judging guilt by category, then punishment by category. We intend to
                                require all twelve jury members to conclude the punishment fits the crime. We fully
                                intend for jury members to consider their own behavior and opinion on morality; thus, we
                                expect it to be the prosecutor's job to explain why an act is harmful if there are jury
                                members who disagree. We expect jury members to ask more questions along those lines.
                                The jury is currently being used as a scapegoat for horrifically harsh punishment under
                                the mask the jury convicted him knowing the jury would not have convicted them had they
                                known what was to happen.</p>
                            <p>This is linked to the U. S. Constitution through the 7th Amendment which reads, the right
                                of trial by jury shall be preserved.</p>
                            <p>Also the 8th Amendment which reads, no excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual
                                punishments inflicted.</p>
                            <p>The history of criminal prosecution is long, bloody, unjust, and downright ludicrous in
                                many cases. – Sean Patrick.</p>

                            expense report related to that charge. Those expenses shall be paid by the court to the

                            <p>We wish to fully reimburse defendants who are not convicted to prohibit monetary attacks.
                                We wish to stop the persecution strategy of bankrupting a defendant with false charges
                                to remove their ability to employ representation for other charges. We wish to remove
                                false accusations. We wish to remove weak and flimsy accusations. We wish to stop the
                                slander of a defendant's character by an abundance of charges with little to no

                            <p>We acknowledge we will need more courthouses, but far fewer prisons. One of the effects
                                of this law is to encourage private attorneys to offer defendants their services with no
                                or little up-front payments. Most, if not all, defendants who have even a slight chance
                                of winning will be able to obtain a private attorney who can dedicate the necessary
                                hours to the case to provide a reasonably good defense with respect to the defendant's
                                situation. There will still be a need for public defenders for cases where there are no
                                private attorneys willing to represent.</p>
                            <p>This is linked to the U. S. Constitution through the 5th Amendment which reads, "no
                                person shall . . .be deprived of . . . property, without [a conviction]."</p>

                        <p>Law of Ryvah 3. Defendants who suffer from chemical intoxication may be
                            detained at a hospital with a
                            doctor's approval. Defendants who suffer from rage may be detained at a

                            doctor's approval. A defendant may not be incarcerated for a charge (or
                            set of charges) that
                            combined carries a maximum sentence of less than three years until after
                            a guilty verdict has been

                            or mental institution without a doctor's release) within the past six

                            violates this law shall pay the defendant a fine of one AIPH for every
                            hour for every charge the
                            defendant is incarcerated via FPS until they are released or a guilty

                            <p>The fundamental principal we are adhering to is innocent until proven
                                guilty. We recognize a
                                defendant may pose an immediate threat due to drugs or rage. Those
                                defendants need help. They
                                need access to medical and psychiatric care. Further, we intend to
                                fully strip the police from
                                having the power to incarcerate a person. The police are not judges
                                nor jury and shall not be
                                executioner. On the other hand, when a defendant demonstrates they
                                are unwilling to participate
                                in the judicial system (failing to attend court, etc.), then we are
                                left with no alternative.
                                Notice the focus is on small crimes that can render a maximum
                                sentence of less than three years.
                                We will handle more serious charges with the Seventh Law of Ryvah.
                            </p>
                            <p>Further, we intend to empower defendants to be able to acquire a fair
                                trial as required by the
                                U.S. Constitution. We intend for defendants to be free and able to
                                do research and assist in
                                their own defense. We intend to prohibit the demoralization,
                                depression, and desperation
                                intentionally, maliciously, and strategically inflicted on the
                                defendant. The most important
                                goal is to eliminate all scenarios of "time served" where a
                                defendant (even an innocent one)
                                will accept a guilty verdict because they have already served more
                                time than would have been
                                required if they had been guilty. This is the default approach to
                                convictions for small
                                accusations. Our government has millions of these convictions. The
                                majority of people who have
                                been convicted of a crime, and served under six months, are
                                innocent. They did not commit the
                                crime. In fact, most cases take over a year to get to trial,
                                frequently two or three years. The
                                morality of keeping a defendant in jail for three years when they
                                are facing a maximum three
                                year sentence is horrific – well that is where we were as of 2021.
                                And we must correct this.</p>

                            with a witness (who is not part
                            of law enforcement) more than six hours after the discovery of a
                            potential crime, then they must
                            record the entire communication. If the communication is done in person,
                            then they must video record
                            the witness and officer, and the first thing communicated to the witness
                            must be, "This is being

                            comply with this, is an argument a witness has been dissuaded and both

                            intent. The survey is to
                            consist only of people of an age within two years of the current age of
                            sexual consent. The survey

                            <p>This is the only cultural Law of Ryvah. Thus, it is radically
                                different from all the others. It
                                also serves as a template for all other cultural laws. The rest of
                                the Laws of Ryvah are
                                intended to protect freedom and love for all eternity without any
                                change to the law. By
                                contrast, a cultural law is designed to automatically and
                                dynamically modify itself with the ebb
                                and flow of culture, religion, and science.</p>
                            <p>The key aspect of this template is a reoccurring reevaluation. Every
                                ten years it will be
                                adjusted. The second key aspect is the non-biased survey restricted
                                to the relevant population
                                where the most accurate data can be obtained.</p>
                            <p>The next key aspect is the exact definition of the question
                                (parameter of data collection) and
                                how it will be interpreted. This is important because any wiggle
                                room here could subject the law
                                to manipulation by corrupting the question or how the results will
                                be interpreted. When
                                designing other cultural laws it is important to expect the elite in
                                power are going to attempt
                                to sabotage it.</p>
                            <p>Another key element that is very subtle is the question echoes the
                                exact text of the current laws
                                which regulate that aspect of culture. We want to establish a
                                one-to-one connection. We should
                                be able to claim if you are saying yes to this question, then you
                                are violating the associated
                                criminal law; conversely if you are not, then you are not.</p>
                            <p>The next key element is the motivator clause. This prohibits the
                                avoidance of a survey to
                                circumvent the law in total. If the government wishes to ignore the
                                requirement to host a
                                survey, then it shall be subject to an unpalatable consequence. As
                                for the topic of this
                                template of a cultural law being the age of sexual consent, it is
                                probably the most appropriate
                                topic based on the vast diversity and intense emotional
                                passion/hatred this topic possesses.
                                Other good subjects for cultural laws would be the criminalization
                                of alcohol, drugs,
                                homosexuality, pornography, blasphemy, infidelity, slavery, and many
                                more. All of which could be
                                broken down. For example, many countries have criminalized
                                homosexuality differently for men
                                than for women.</p>
                            <p>Next, to understand how to interpret the data, please notice the
                                question asks for a number(an
                                age. Notice, at 25% we define the age. Observe that extreme numbers
                                are irrelevant. Look at this
                                set of numbers (17, 17, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 9999). In this
                                example our result is 18
                                which lands on the 25% mark. The fact someone suggested an
                                outlandish 9999 is irrelevant. It is
                                simply one number and has no more weight than any other number.
                                Further we should understand 25%
                                of the population will be in violation of the law. As far as we are
                                concerned, 25% is very
                                arbitrary. The relevance of it is to identify the severity of a
                                violation of the law. As we
                                increase 25% to 30% we decrease the severity of the law. Likewise as
                                we decrease the 25% down to
                                20% we increase the severity. To put this in perspective, 30% of the
                                population will get a
                                speeding ticket. 5% will get a DUI. 1% will be convicted of a minor
                                felony of less than two
                                years in jail. This forces us to conclude cultural laws do not
                                follow any level of logic or
                                reasonability.</p>

                            <p>Historically we know the painting "Daybreak" by Maxfield Parish
                                depicting a nude girl was the
                                most popular image on earth in 1925 with reproductions of it found
                                in 25% of all American
                                households. We know in 1945 the U.S. Army used a bare-breasted woman
                                on posters to recruit men
                                for WWII. Since then there has been an agenda to demonize all forms
                                of nudity by the extreme
                                elite.</p>

                                nude as God created Adam and Eve suffers from an extreme
                                psychological disorder caused by this
                                unnatural manipulation and needs to be admitted to a psyche ward for
                                mental correction. The
                                de-normalization of observing nudity has manifested perversions of
                                human sexuality including
                                sodomy, bestiality, sexual sadistic and masochistic abuse, sexual
                                mutilation, sexual violence,
                                and non-biological homosexuality. We observe there has been an
                                enormous increase since 1945 in
                                all of these behaviors. We acknowledge that a small percentage of
                                humanity is biologically
                                homosexual. They are born that way. It matters not how they are
                                raised. We also know many people
                                who claim to be homosexual are not, and it is only a perversion of
                                their true form. Our goal is
                                to once again normalize nudity as it has been for thousands of
                                years.</p>

                            <p>The goal is innocent until proven guilty. Here it is at the court's
                                discretion/risk to
                                incarcerate a defendant prior to a guilty verdict. Notice, a
                                defendant does not need to be found
                                innocent. It does not matter why a defendant is not found guilty. If
                                the court drops the
                                charges, then the court pays the fine. If the defendant dies, then
                                the court pays the fine. If
                                the defendant gets a hung jury, then the court pays the fine. If a
                                defendant is found guilty on
                                one charge, but not guilty on the second charge, then the court pays
                                the fine on the second
                                charge. Notice, the more charges filed, the more risk is burdened.
                                Each and every charge that
                                does not generate a guilty verdict generates the fine. Our goal is
                                for only legitimate charges
                                to be filed. We also want a conservativeConcerning court. Once a
                                court can guarantee a sentence
                                of thirty or more years, additional charges are moot.</p>
                            <p>As a side note, the practice of a sentence being reduced should be
                                mostly eliminated. Thirty
                                years should be thirty years with something like a 20% discount for
                                good behavior. It is treason
                                to intentionally misinform the public. If a person's minimum
                                sentence is only four years because
                                they will get 33% time and can earn up to six years off for
                                educational programs, then it is
                                unethical to tell the people 30 years (30x33%=10, 10-6=4).</p>
                            <p>It is very important to recognize that 100% of this fine is
                                avoidable. A court never needs to
                                risk a payment. Simply do not incarcerate innocent defendants prior
                                to a guilty verdict. If the
                                court is at all concerned with obtaining a guilty verdict, simply do
                                not put them in jail. That,

                                at risk." A person is put at risk the moment they are arrested. The
                                Constitution has been

                            <p>A. The goal is to remove unconstitutional material (laws,
                                presidential executive orders, etc.)
                                from our country. To succeed we must remove them faster than they
                                are being added. By
                                establishing a substantial financial reward that makes it profitable
                                to challenge laws, we can
                                accomplish this goal. We also wish to simplify the books. Having
                                excessive information increases
                                the difficulty of maintaining a free nation. Laws should be made
                                clear and concise as to leave
                                no room for misinterpretation. It should be agreed that the only
                                requirement to challenge a law
                                is a belief that it is unconstitutional and violates our rights. A
                                person does not need to have
                                been injured by the law. It should not be expected that a person be
                                personally affected by an
                                unconstitutional law to challenge it. For by then it is too late and
                                their rights have been
                                violated. It is our goal to incentivise a radical transformation
                                from oppression to freedom in
                                which anyone can participate. The implementation of this law will
                                dramatically increase public
                                awareness and interest in the matter of knowing what a fair and just
                                government ought to look
                                like and increase public awareness of how far we have diverted from
                                the Constitution. This will
                                shed light on unconstitutional laws that have been passed and shame
                                our current government for
                                allowing it.</p>

                                            even a slight chance of winning will be able to obtain a
                                            private attorney who can
                                            dedicate the necessary hours to the case to provide a

                                            respect to the defendant's situation. There will still
                                            be a need for public
                                            defenders for cases where there are no private attorneys

                                        <p>(Explanation of 3rd Law – Under Three Years)</p>
                                        <p>The fundamental principal we are adhering to is innocent
                                            until proven guilty. We
                                            recognize a defendant may pose an immediate threat due
                                            to drugs or rage. Those
                                            defendants need help. They need access to medical and
                                            psychiatric care. Further, we
                                            intend to fully strip the police from having the power
                                            to incarcerate a person. The
                                            police are not judges nor jury and shall not be
                                            executioner. On the other hand, when
                                            a defendant demonstrates they are unwilling to
                                            participate in the judicial system
                                            (failing to attend court, etc.), then we are left with
                                            no alternative. Notice the
                                            focus is on small crimes that can render a maximum
                                            sentence of less than three
                                            years. We will handle more serious charges with the
                                            Seventh Law of Ryvah.</p>
                                        <p>Further, we intend to empower defendants to be able to
                                            acquire a fair trial as
                                            required by the U.S. Constitution. We intend for
                                            defendants to be free and able to
                                            do research and assist in their own defense. We intend
                                            to prohibit the
                                            demoralization, depression, and desperation
                                            intentionally, maliciously, and
                                            strategically inflicted on the defendant. The most
                                            important goal is to eliminate
                                            all scenarios of "time served" where a defendant (even
                                            an innocent one) will accept
                                            a guilty verdict because they have already served more
                                            time than would have been
                                            required if they had been guilty. This is the default
                                            approach to convictions for
                                            small accusations. Our government has millions of these
                                            convictions. The majority of
                                            people who have been convicted of a crime, and served
                                            under six months, are
                                            innocent. They did not commit the crime. In fact, most
                                            cases take over a year to get
                                            to trial, frequently two or three years. The morality of
                                            keeping a defendant in jail
                                            for three years when they are facing a maximum three
                                            year sentence is horrific –
                                            well that is where we were as of 2021. And we must
                                            correct this.</p>

                                        communicates with a witness (who
                                        is not part of law enforcement) more than six hours after
                                        the discovery of a potential
                                        crime, then they must record the entire communication. If

                                        person, then they must video record the witness and officer,
                                        and the first thing
                                        communicated to the witness must be, "This is being
                                        recorded," and the interview must
                                        end with, "This concludes our questions." Failure of an
                                        officer to comply with this, is

                                    <p>Law of Ryvah 5. Age of sexual consent is to be determined
                                        every ten years by non-biased
                                        survey and defined as the age at which twenty-five percent

                                        has voluntarily and intentionally pursued and had any form
                                        of physical contact with
                                        sexual intent. The survey is to consist only of people of an
                                        age within two years of the
                                        current age of sexual consent. The survey question shall be:
                                        "At what age (did you or do you intend to)
                                        voluntarily and intentionally touch any person with the intent to

                                        years without a survey) the
                                        age of sexual consent shall decrease by one year per year until
                                        reestablished by a survey.

                                        <p>(Explanation of 5th Law – Age of Consent)</p>
                                        <p>This is the only cultural Law of Ryvah. Thus, it is
                                            radically different from all the
                                            others. It also serves as a template for all other
                                            cultural laws. The rest of the
                                            Laws of Ryvah are intended to protect freedom and love
                                            for all eternity without any
                                            change to the law. By contrast, a cultural law is
                                            designed to automatically and
                                            dynamically modify itself with the ebb and flow of
                                            culture, religion, and science.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The key aspect of this template is a reoccurring
                                            reevaluation. Every ten years it
                                            will be adjusted. The second key aspect is the
                                            non-biased survey restricted to the
                                            relevant population where the most accurate data can be
                                            obtained.</p>
                                        <p>The next key aspect is the exact definition of the
                                            question (parameter of data
                                            collection) and how it will be interpreted. This is
                                            important because any wiggle
                                            room here could subject the law to manipulation by
                                            corrupting the question or how
                                            the results will be interpreted. When designing other
                                            cultural laws it is important
                                            to expect the elite in power are going to attempt to
                                            sabotage it.</p>
                                        <p>Another key element that is very subtle is the question
                                            echoes the exact text of the
                                            current laws which regulate that aspect of culture. We
                                            want to establish a
                                            one-to-one connection. We should be able to claim if you
                                            are saying yes to this question, then you
                                            are violating the associated criminal law; conversely if you are not, then
                                            you are not.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The next key element is the motivator clause. This
                                            prohibits the avoidance of a
                                            survey to circumvent the law in total. If the government
                                            wishes to ignore the
                                            requirement to host a survey, then it shall be subject
                                            to an unpalatable
                                            consequence. As for the topic of this template of a
                                            cultural law being the age of
                                            sexual consent, it is probably the most appropriate
                                            topic based on the vast
                                            diversity and intense emotional passion/hatred this
                                            topic possesses. Other good
                                            subjects for cultural laws would be the criminalization
                                            of alcohol, drugs,
                                            homosexuality, pornography, blasphemy, infidelity,
                                            slavery, and many more. All of
                                            which could be broken down. For example, many countries
                                            have criminalized
                                            homosexuality differently for men than for women.</p>
                                        <p>Next, to understand how to interpret the data, please
                                            notice the question asks for a
                                            number(an age. Notice, at 25% we define the age. Observe
                                            that extreme numbers are
                                            irrelevant. Look at this set of numbers (17, 17, 18, 18,
                                            18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 9999).
                                            In this example our result is 18 which lands on the 25%
                                            mark. The fact someone
                                            suggested an outlandish 9999 is irrelevant. It is simply
                                            one number and has no more
                                            weight than any other number. Further we should
                                            understand 25% of the population
                                            will be in violation of the law. As far as we are
                                            concerned, 25% is very arbitrary.
                                            The relevance of it is to identify the severity of a
                                            violation of the law. As we
                                            increase 25% to 30% we decrease the severity of the law.
                                            Likewise as we decrease the
                                            25% down to 20% we increase the severity. To put this in
                                            perspective, 30% of the
                                            population will get a speeding ticket. 5% will get a
                                            DUI. 1% will be convicted of a
                                            minor felony of less than two years in jail. This forces
                                            us to conclude cultural
                                            laws do not follow any level of logic or reasonability.

                                            first age of consent laws took shape under the
                                            guidance of the Council of
                                            Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission to
                                            install a mechanism that could
                                            control civil unrest, and remove the leader of an
                                            uprising. It had nothing to do
                                            with protecting children – that was just a sales pitch.

                                        <p>(Explanation of 6th Law – Nudity)</p>
                                        <p>Historically we know the painting "Daybreak" by Maxfield Parish
                                            depicting a nude girl was the most popular image on earth in 1925 with
                                            reproductions of
                                            it found
                                            in 25% of all American households. We know in 1945 the U.S. Army used a
                                            bare-breasted
                                            woman on
                                            posters to recruit men for WWII. Since then there has been an agenda to
                                            demonize all
                                            forms of
                                            nudity by the extreme elite.</p>
                                        <p>Anyone who is so fearful, offended, or terrified of beholding a
                                            fellow member of humanity in the nude as God created Adam and Eve suffers
                                            from an
                                            extreme
                                            psychological disorder caused by this unnatural manipulation and needs to be
                                            admitted to
                                            a
                                            psyche ward for mental correction. The de-normalization of observing nudity
                                            has
                                            manifested
                                            perversions of human sexuality including sodomy, bestiality, sexual sadistic
                                            and
                                            masochistic
                                            abuse, sexual mutilation, sexual violence, and non-biological homosexuality.
                                            We observe
                                            there
                                            has been an enormous increase since 1945 in all of these behaviors. We
                                            acknowledge that
                                            a small
                                            percentage of humanity is biologically homosexual. They are born that way.
                                            It matters
                                            not how
                                            they are raised. We also know many people who claim to be homosexual are
                                            not, and it is
                                            only
                                            a perversion of their true form. Our goal is to once again normalize nudity
                                            as it has
                                            been for
                                            thousands of years.</p>

                                        <p>The goal is innocent until proven guilty. Here it is at the court's
                                            discretion/risk to
                                            incarcerate a defendant prior to a guilty verdict. Notice, a defendant does
                                            not need to
                                            be found
                                            innocent. It does not matter why a defendant is not found guilty. If the
                                            court drops the
                                            charges,
                                            then the court pays the fine. If the defendant dies, then the court pays the
                                            fine. If
                                            the
                                            defendant gets a hung jury, then the court pays the fine. If a defendant is
                                            found guilty
                                            on
                                            one charge, but not guilty on the second charge, then the court pays the
                                            fine on the
                                            second
                                            charge. Notice, the more charges filed, the more risk is burdened. Each and
                                            every charge
                                            that
                                            does not generate a guilty verdict generates the fine. Our goal is for only
                                            legitimate
                                            charges
                                            to be filed. We also want a conservativeConcerning court. Once a court can
                                            guarantee a
                                            sentence
                                            of thirty or more years, additional charges are moot.</p>
                                        <p>As a side note, the practice of a sentence being reduced should be mostly
                                            eliminated.
                                            Thirty
                                            years should be thirty years with something like a 20% discount for good
                                            behavior. It is
                                            treason
                                            to intentionally misinform the public. If a person's minimum sentence is
                                            only four years
                                            because
                                            they will get 33% time and can earn up to six years off for educational
                                            programs, then
                                            it is
                                            unethical to tell the people 30 years (30x33%=10, 10-6=4).</p>
                                        <p>It is very important to recognize that 100% of this fine is avoidable. A
                                            court never
                                            needs to
                                            risk a payment. Simply do not incarcerate innocent defendants prior to a
                                            guilty verdict.
                                            If the
                                            court is at all concerned with obtaining a guilty verdict, simply do not put
                                            them in
                                            jail. That,
                                            of course, is the true objective. Jail should be reserved for the guilty.

                                        <p>Obviously, this is enforcing double jeopardy. The Constitution reads, "no man
                                            shall twice
                                            be put
                                            at risk." A person is put at risk the moment they are arrested. The
                                            Constitution has
                                            been
                                            subverted in many ways. The prosecution can re-file. . .not anymore. A hung

                                            law, the defendant prepares the defense only once. If they are not
                                            convicted, then it is

                                        <p>A. The goal is to remove unconstitutional material (laws, presidential
                                            executive orders,
                                            etc.)
                                            from our country. To succeed we must remove them faster than they are being
                                            added. By
                                            establishing a substantial financial reward that makes it profitable to
                                            challenge laws,
                                            we can
                                            accomplish this goal. We also wish to simplify the books. Having excessive
                                            information
                                            increases
                                            the difficulty of maintaining a free nation. Laws should be made clear and
                                            concise as to
                                            leave
                                            no room for misinterpretation. It should be agreed that the only requirement
                                            to
                                            challenge a law
                                            is a belief that it is unconstitutional and violates our rights. A person
                                            does not need
                                            to have
                                            been injured by the law. It should not be expected that a person be
                                            personally affected
                                            by an
                                            unconstitutional law to challenge it. For by then it is too late and their
                                            rights have
                                            been
                                            violated. It is our goal to incentivise a radical transformation from
                                            oppression to
                                            freedom in
                                            which anyone can participate. The implementation of this law will
                                            dramatically increase
                                            public
                                            awareness and interest in the matter of knowing what a fair and just
                                            government ought to
                                            look
                                            like and increase public awareness of how far we have diverted from the
                                            Constitution.
                                            This will
                                            shed light on unconstitutional laws that have been passed and shame our
                                            current
                                            government for

                                                        fewer prisons. One of the
                                                        effects of this law is to encourage private attorneys to

                                                        even a slight chance of winning will be able to obtain a

                                                        be a need for public
                                                        defenders for cases where there are no private attorneys

                                                    <p>The fundamental principal we are adhering to is innocent
                                                        until proven guilty. We
                                                        recognize a defendant may pose an immediate threat due
                                                        to drugs or rage. Those
                                                        defendants need help. They need access to medical and
                                                        psychiatric care. Further, we
                                                        intend to fully strip the police from having the power
                                                        to incarcerate a person. The
                                                        police are not judges nor jury and shall not be

                                                        a defendant demonstrates they are unwilling to

                                                        (failing to attend court, etc.), then we are left with
                                                        no alternative. Notice the
                                                        focus is on small crimes that can render a maximum

                                                    <p>Further, we intend to empower defendants to be able to
                                                        acquire a fair trial as
                                                        required by the U.S. Constitution. We intend for
                                                        defendants to be free and able to
                                                        do research and assist in their own defense. We intend
                                                        to prohibit the
                                                        demoralization, depression, and desperation
                                                        intentionally, maliciously, and
                                                        strategically inflicted on the defendant. The most
                                                        important goal is to eliminate
                                                        all scenarios of "time served" where a defendant (even
                                                        an innocent one) will accept
                                                        a guilty verdict because they have already served more
                                                        time than would have been
                                                        required if they had been guilty. This is the default
                                                        approach to convictions for
                                                        small accusations. Our government has millions of these
                                                        convictions. The majority of
                                                        people who have been convicted of a crime, and served
                                                        under six months, are
                                                        innocent. They did not commit the crime. In fact, most
                                                        cases take over a year to get
                                                        to trial, frequently two or three years. The morality of
                                                        keeping a defendant in jail
                                                        for three years when they are facing a maximum three
                                                        year sentence is horrific –

                                                    <p>The key aspect of this template is a reoccurring
                                                        reevaluation. Every ten years it
                                                        will be adjusted. The second key aspect is the
                                                        non-biased survey restricted to the
                                                        relevant population where the most accurate data can be
                                                        obtained.</p>
                                                    <p>The next key aspect is the exact definition of the
                                                        question (parameter of data
                                                        collection) and how it will be interpreted. This is
                                                        important because any wiggle
                                                        room here could subject the law to manipulation by
                                                        corrupting the question or how
                                                        the results will be interpreted. When designing other
                                                        cultural laws it is important
                                                        to expect the elite in power are going to attempt to
                                                        sabotage it.</p>
                                                    <p>Another key element that is very subtle is the question
                                                        echoes the exact text of the
                                                        current laws which regulate that aspect of culture. We
                                                        want to establish a
                                                        one-to-one connection. We should be able to claim if you
                                                        are saying yes to this
                                                        question, then you are violating the associated criminal
                                                        law; conversely if you are
                                                        not, then you are not.</p>
                                                    <p>The next key element is the motivator clause. This
                                                        prohibits the avoidance of a
                                                        survey to circumvent the law in total. If the government
                                                        wishes to ignore the
                                                        requirement to host a survey, then it shall be subject
                                                        to an unpalatable
                                                        consequence. As for the topic of this template of a
                                                        cultural law being the age of
                                                        sexual consent, it is probably the most appropriate
                                                        topic based on the vast
                                                        diversity and intense emotional passion/hatred this
                                                        topic possesses. Other good
                                                        subjects for cultural laws would be the criminalization
                                                        of alcohol, drugs,
                                                        homosexuality, pornography, blasphemy, infidelity,
                                                        slavery, and many more. All of
                                                        which could be broken down. For example, many countries
                                                        have criminalized
                                                        homosexuality differently for men than for women.</p>
                                                    <p>Next, to understand how to interpret the data, please
                                                        notice the question asks for a
                                                        number(an age. Notice, at 25% we define the age. Observe
                                                        that extreme numbers are
                                                        irrelevant. Look at this set of numbers (17, 17, 18, 18,
                                                        18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 9999).
                                                        In this example our result is 18 which lands on the 25%
                                                        mark. The fact someone
                                                        suggested an outlandish 9999 is irrelevant. It is simply
                                                        one number and has no more
                                                        weight than any other number. Further we should
                                                        understand 25% of the population
                                                        will be in violation of the law. As far as we are
                                                        concerned, 25% is very arbitrary.
                                                        The relevance of it is to identify the severity of a
                                                        violation of the law. As we
                                                        increase 25% to 30% we decrease the severity of the law.
                                                        Likewise as we decrease the
                                                        25% down to 20% we increase the severity. To put this in
                                                        perspective, 30% of the
                                                        population will get a speeding ticket. 5% will get a
                                                        DUI. 1% will be convicted of a
                                                        minor felony of less than two years in jail. This forces
                                                        us to conclude cultural
                                                        laws do not follow any level of logic or reasonability.

                                                        behaviors. We
                                                        acknowledge that a small
                                                        percentage of humanity is biologically homosexual. They are born
                                                        that way.

                                                        they are raised. We also know many people who claim to be

                                                        innocent. It does not matter why a defendant is not found
                                                        guilty. If the

                                                        charge. Notice, the more charges filed, the more risk is

                                                        Taxpayer money should never go for lobbying. We pay them to do a

                                                    everyone
                                                    convicted of the act automatically has that conviction removed and
                                                    voided. When
                                                    this occurs, all evidence of the act possessed by all government
                                                    agencies is to
                                                    be given to the defendant and nothing shall be retained by any

                                                    <p>The statement we make when we declare an act is not a crime is
                                                        the act should
                                                        never have been a crime. The idea is to support the fighters for
                                                        freedom. If

                                                        a fighter
                                                        for freedom is to promote oppression and discourage people from
                                                        fighting for
                                                        freedom. The removal of all evidence supports this goal and
                                                        inhibits post
                                                        reform retaliation. By giving the evidence to the defendant, we
                                                        restore
                                                        their faith. They can fight for what they believe in and win.

                                                        for interpretation. This is our goal. In truth, all legal terms
                                                        should have
                                                        such explicit definitions. Our goal here is to sever this term
                                                        in half. The
                                                        half that contains malice, violence, force, and is clearly
                                                        unwanted, keeps
                                                        the old definition with these new requirements. Truthfully,
                                                        without these
                                                        requirements, the old definition is unconstitutional in several
                                                        ways: 1.
                                                        Freedom of speech, 2. It is vague, 3. It is over broad, 4. It
                                                        prohibits the
                                                        right to pursue happiness.</p>
                                                    <p>The second definition of the term is devoid of malice, violence,
                                                        force, and
                                                        is not unwanted. We have to acknowledge an enormous range of
                                                        behavior by
                                                        parents, friends, siblings, fans, and behaviors as people
                                                        mature,
                                                        experiment, and practice courtship. The selection of a person
                                                        whom you will
                                                        have children with is the single most important decision a
                                                        person will make
                                                        during their life. Because of this, the infringement must only
                                                        be at the
                                                        point where sex could be eminent. To establish sex could be
                                                        eminent, we
                                                        qualify the act with "an expectation that as a result of the act
                                                        sex could
                                                        occur." This is not meant to be easy to establish. It is
                                                        intended to allow a
                                                        person to cultivate a relation to the point of marriage which
                                                        would not
                                                        occur until the subject is legal. This would allow loyalty to be
                                                        proven, but
                                                        more importantly, if the relation fails the subject is unharmed
                                                        and benefits
                                                        greatly from having it. Truth be told, all of these relations
                                                        would be
                                                        expected to end prior to marriage, especially as the age of
                                                        marriage
                                                        continues to rise. The benefits to a person who practices social
                                                        interaction, dating, and courtship are enormous. A second
                                                        byproduct is well
                                                        employed and educated breadwinners are likely to comprise the
                                                        other half of
                                                        the relation establishing very high expectations in the subject.

                                                    <p>(Explanation of 14th Law – Marriage)</p>
                                                    <p>Our goal is to remove marriage from government. Marriage is
                                                        clearly a
                                                        religious act. Our Constitution states "we shall respect no
                                                        religion." Our
                                                        government has no business using the word marriage, domestic
                                                        partnership, or
                                                        any other religious act. There should be no laws that reference
                                                        either,
                                                        anywhere, ever. It is the respecting of a religion which has
                                                        established
                                                        what amounts to a monetary bribe. A monetary bribe which is at
                                                        the core a
                                                        conflict. As soon as we recognize this and remove the bribe, all
                                                        arguments
                                                        over marriage will be moot.</p>
                                                    <p>I have no objection to contracts unless they are verbal. Verbal
                                                        contracts are
                                                        prolific with problems, I love marriage contracts that clearly
                                                        spell out the
                                                        rights, privileges, obligations, and consequences. A good
                                                        contract clearly
                                                        identifies what happens in a breach or termination of contract.
                                                        It
                                                        identifies expectations and represents a meeting of the minds

                                                        party is taking abusive advantage of the other. The government
                                                        should not
                                                        pay a man and a woman to enter into a particular contract while
                                                        failing to
                                                        pay three men who do the same. One contract should not have
                                                        benefits and
                                                        privileges such as survivor benefits or legal immunity for sex
                                                        acts when
                                                        other contracts do not. The government should not respect one
                                                        contract over
                                                        another, especially when the contract is founded in religious
                                                        ceremony and
                                                        structure; that is respecting religion. Imagine if you can, a
                                                        tax law that
                                                        paid you $100,000 per year if you were a man with five or more
                                                        wives. In
                                                        other words, respecting a polygamous religion. Oh, and we will

                                                        respects religion, violates the Constitution, and cannot be

                                                    <p>B. National security is not a reason to violate our rights. It is
                                                        a reason
                                                        for full transparency. Also in part B, we are specifically
                                                        excluding body
                                                        cams, hand held cameras and cameras on vehicles. It is intended
                                                        the
                                                        Fifteenth Law covers different aspects of surveillance. Notice
                                                        part A is
                                                        only one AIPY while part B is ten AIPY. That is because
                                                        surveillance from
                                                        structures fixed on real property is capable of revealing much
                                                        darker
                                                        secrets. Consider the video footage from September 11th, 2001 of
                                                        the
                                                        Pentagon attack. 104 cameras on structures were seized in the
                                                        interest of
                                                        national security. Never again! I want the footage on those
                                                        cameras made
                                                        public. Those cameras would provide proof of the perpetrator of
                                                        the attack.

                                                    "do not do an
                                                    action," are to maintain or assume inaction. If law enforcement,
                                                    fire
                                                    protection, or health protection officials make demands and a
                                                    defendant fails to
                                                    comply, then that grants the officials the right to use force to
                                                    protect people,
                                                    acquire license, and acquire insurance information. Further,
                                                    termination of
                                                    employment, licenses, or memberships does not represent a fine.
                                                    Removing a
                                                    defendant from private property which the defendant is not leasing
                                                    or the owner
                                                    thereof represents protecting the people. Agreeing to perform a task
                                                    is intended
                                                    to apply to health and safety responsibilities such as police, fire
                                                    protection,
                                                    military, and even baby sitters. The ability for such people to
                                                    relinquish their
                                                    agreed upon responsibility is contingent on the ability of someone
                                                    else taking
                                                    over. Further, it can never be interpreted a person has agreed to
                                                    break the law;
                                                    thus, subject to arrest, etc. for inaction. Further, it is to be
                                                    interpreted
                                                    this does not infringe on the publicly accepted policy and practices
                                                    of law
                                                    enforcement to control a person who is incarcerated, under arrest,
                                                    has a warrant
                                                    for their arrest, or a suspect with sufficient evidence to arrest.
                                                    Additionally
                                                    aiding an organization is also excluded. In other words, law
                                                    enforcement can
                                                    document your conduct (such as not wearing a helmet while riding a
                                                    motorcycle)
                                                    and communicate it to an organization which has established a
                                                    contract you
                                                    agreed to which established a fine for that conduct.</p>

                                                    <p>(Explanation of 18th Law – Inaction)</p>
                                                    <p>This concept is difficult; inaction is not a crime. Yet, if you
                                                        agree to take
                                                        on a responsibility and then do not do it, this is one action
                                                        over a long
                                                        stretch of time. It is not inaction. A babysitter is not
                                                        inactive if she
                                                        does not intervene to protect the child she is responsible for.
                                                        Giving birth
                                                        to a child is an action that lasts 18 years. Getting elected
                                                        president is an
                                                        action that lasts four years. My litmus test is a dead body is
                                                        in a state of
                                                        total inaction. A dead body can never be held to have broken a
                                                        law. A dead
                                                        president immediately relinquishes all his responsibilities;
                                                        thus, his dead
                                                        body cannot fail to do something. It has no responsibilities.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Next we need to acknowledge the need of law enforcement to
                                                        prevent future
                                                        actions by ordering a subject to "stop." This is to err in good
                                                        faith of law
                                                        enforcement. While we have a lot of very unethical police who
                                                        will kill an
                                                        innocent man, we also have a lot of unethical people who will
                                                        kill a
                                                        policeman. If the officer orders you to drop your gun, I don't
                                                        care if it's
                                                        a cell phone, I don't care if it will smash on the concrete, you
                                                        need to
                                                        release it immediately with your fingers spread apart and your
                                                        hands away
                                                        from your body in plain clear view while you yell "yes, sir" in
                                                        a controlled
                                                        firm voice of respect and fear acknowledging there may be a law
                                                        enforcement
                                                        officer pointing a lethal weapon at you who is already fearful
                                                        for his life.
                                                        A defendant who plays games, jokes around, or does not take the
                                                        situation
                                                        seriously, has earned the right to die. No part of this law is
                                                        intended to
                                                        protect you in situations like this.</p>
                                                    <p>The next aspect may be even more complex to explain, the use of
                                                        force as
                                                        granted by inaction. If you are in a motor vehicle and wish to
                                                        be inactive,
                                                        then the officer gains the privilege of removing you from the
                                                        vehicle. If he
                                                        cannot locate your lawful privilege of using the roads taxpayers
                                                        built using
                                                        taxpayer money where taxpayers established a requirement to be
                                                        licensed,
                                                        then your car is getting removed from the road and it will not
                                                        be allowed to
                                                        be a threat to the public safety. My advice is to help the
                                                        officer help you
                                                        overcome whatever problem you have. If you are on private
                                                        property, you have
                                                        a choice, walk off or be dragged off.</p>
                                                    <p>Next the subpoena, this is required. Your rights to inaction do
                                                        not protect
                                                        you from the needs of the citizens of this country to compel you
                                                        to testify
                                                        as a witness. Honestly, if I could make a dead man talk, I
                                                        would. Notice
                                                        that I do not reserve the ability to compel a person to serve on
                                                        a jury. It
                                                        is my intention and hope that jury members will be financially
                                                        compensated
                                                        for their time based on either minimum wage for the unemployed
                                                        or 150% of a
                                                        juror's established verifiable income.</p>
                                                    <p>Next the concept of failing to purchase a product is aimed
                                                        directly at health
                                                        care. I think a national health care program based on the Oregon
                                                        plan is a
                                                        great idea, but it must be funded from the general fund. All
                                                        health
                                                        insurance companies must be removed and the medical procedures
                                                        offered must
                                                        be based on a cost-to-benefit analysis from greatest ratio of
                                                        benefits to
                                                        least. There are to be no levels of care so that congressmen and
                                                        homeless

                                                    <p>It is understood that many people believe that vaccines are used
                                                        to
                                                        depopulate the world. There is evidence to suggest the aids

                                                        distributed via vaccine. Many people believe that vaccines are
                                                        used to dumb
                                                        down and sedate the population into a state of lethargic apathy
                                                        and
                                                        acceptance of an indoctrination into slave labor. It is a fact
                                                        there is a

                                                        children and
                                                        autism in children. We need only look at the cyanide laced
                                                        Kool-aid the
                                                        citizens of Jamestown were compelled to drink. To understand the

                                                        requirement to prohibit any government from compelling the
                                                        citizens to take
                                                        any vaccine. This law is intended to prohibit the government

                                                        as defined

                                                        objective. Also

                                                    <p>Freedom of speech is one of our most precious rights. Dolls (and
                                                        their many
                                                        forms) are a branch of art and freedom of speech. There are
                                                        agendas to
                                                        criminalize them. There is already legislation in other
                                                        countries to outlaw
                                                        certain types of dolls. This type of an attack uses parental
                                                        fear with the
                                                        association of horrific crime. They fabricate a crisis. They
                                                        find some
                                                        innocent little girl, and they claim the monster had possession
                                                        of
                                                        (something they want to outlaw) in this case, dolls. They launch
                                                        an
                                                        elaborate advertising campaign to persuade the public the dolls
                                                        caused the
                                                        horrific crime and the only way to protect the public is to
                                                        outlaw the
                                                        dolls. At first they will outlaw only a very specific type of
                                                        doll,
                                                        something nobody really cares about. Once the community has
                                                        accepted this,
                                                        then the definition will be expanded until all dolls are a
                                                        crime. To see
                                                        this progression in implementation you need only watch public TV
                                                        when they
                                                        depict the statue of David (a doll) which is the iconic symbol
                                                        of the nation
                                                        of Italy. Notice how they censor out his mid-section. If you are
                                                        an Italian,
                                                        you should be angry. If you are an American, you should be
                                                        angry. If you are
                                                        a human, you should be angry. No doll can ever be classified as
                                                        a crime.</p>

                                                    <p>We are focusing on innocent until proven guilty and the right to
                                                        a fair trial
                                                        which requires the ability to defend yourself. By taking a
                                                        person's assets,
                                                        the police can inflict extreme hardship, financial loss and
                                                        expense, and
                                                        deny a defendant the ability to defend themselves. If you take
                                                        their car,
                                                        they can't go to work or must rent or purchase a new car. The
                                                        same is true
                                                        of many things. If the police take enough, they can completely
                                                        cripple a
                                                        person: no phone, no computer, no car, no furniture, no dishes,
                                                        no clothing.
                                                        Do you get it yet? Our goal is to force the police to simply
                                                        return the
                                                        property.</p>
                                                    <p>Unfortunately it is not that easy. There is some stuff we do not
                                                        want them to
                                                        return. Obviously we will not return the money they stole from
                                                        the bank, but
                                                        how do we determine this? So we defined categories: chemist,
                                                        judge, jury,
                                                        everything else. Each of these four categories cover a specific
                                                        type of
                                                        property. A chemist is obvious; we use a professional expert to
                                                        make the
                                                        determination. The three remaining are a scale of easy, hard,
                                                        and very hard.
                                                        A judge's assessment is easy. "Hey judge, we don't want to
                                                        return this," –
                                                        prosecutor. "Okay, what's the excuse?" – Judge. As a result,
                                                        this is a very
                                                        narrow list, not just a weapon, but one owned by a convicted
                                                        felon. Notice
                                                        counterfeit money is here, but counterfeit products are not.
                                                        Money is
                                                        intended to include money orders, bank checks, stamps, stocks
                                                        and other
                                                        currencies which are counterfeit. This is key. It in no way
                                                        covers real
                                                        money, real money orders, real bank checks, real stamps, etc. Of
                                                        course the
                                                        next item is stolen property where the true owner can be
                                                        identified. Thus, a
                                                        thief with a hundred dollars (even if you know he stole the
                                                        money, but you
                                                        don't know who from), the police cannot keep it. Why? Because if
                                                        you don't
                                                        know who it was taken from, then the truth is you don't know it
                                                        was stolen.
                                                        I now envision a scenario where the police bust a ring and seize
                                                        a truckload
                                                        of stolen property from hundreds of unidentified victims. Well
                                                        the police
                                                        have three months to identify as many as they can. This is
                                                        intentional. As a
                                                        victim, I want my property back. I envision a lost & found style
                                                        police
                                                        recovery website where victims can identify stolen property and
                                                        search the
                                                        database.</p>
                                                    <p>Next, "something produced by the commission of a crime." Money is
                                                        produced by
                                                        the crime of selling illegal stuff. The bookkeeping records, not
                                                        the
                                                        computer, are produced: however, if these records cannot be
                                                        moved onto
                                                        another computer, then the computer gets sucked in. This is like
                                                        ink on
                                                        paper. If I can't keep the ink without keeping the paper, then
                                                        the police
                                                        get to keep the paper. Of course, there is this mysterious and
                                                        magical
                                                        device called a copy machine that I could claim allows the
                                                        police to keep
                                                        the data and return the paper. Property that was theoretically
                                                        purchased
                                                        with money which was produced by the commission of a crime is
                                                        not a product
                                                        of the crime. It is only indirectly connected. </p>
                                                    <p>The next category is very hard: by a jury trial. This would
                                                        require the
                                                        prosecution to bring the case to trial within three months or
                                                        start paying
                                                        rent, or photograph documents and return the property with a
                                                        lean to seize
                                                        it again upon the determination of a jury. The right to bear
                                                        arms puts
                                                        weapons owned by non-felons in this category. All forms of
                                                        pornography and
                                                        child pornography fall into this category. I trust no judge with
                                                        the
                                                        capacity to know the difference between legal and illegal art.
                                                        Something
                                                        specifically used in the commission of a crime, this is strange
                                                        because it
                                                        would include the murder weapon, this sounds ridiculous until
                                                        you do the
                                                        math: A baseball bat – $7, a kitchen knife – $5, a handgun –
                                                        $200. What is
                                                        10% of $200? Well $20. The conviction of an average gun charge
                                                        will cost
                                                        society between $100,000 and $300,000. If the object is
                                                        important, simply
                                                        pay the rent. Even a couple hundred dollars in rent is perfectly
                                                        acceptable.
                                                        Oh, but now we have a solid precedent that benefits the
                                                        defendant and
                                                        irrelevant property is not economical to keep nor does keeping
                                                        the property
                                                        sabotage the defendant's ability to function. I also want to
                                                        point out if
                                                        the police do their job and get the case to trial within three
                                                        months, none

                                                        Amendment which

                                                    payee's
                                                    attorney who will deduct for unpaid services rendered and then pay
                                                    the balance
                                                    to the payee within 30 days.</p>
                                                <p>The payment to the payee is not considered income and is not subject
                                                    to any form
                                                    of tax. There is an additional fee of 4% on the unpaid balance every
                                                    month (thus
                                                    approximately 82% APR). This four percent fee applies to both the
                                                    payer and the
                                                    payee's attorney. If after each year, the fine, fee, or reward has
                                                    not been paid
                                                    in full, then all the assets of the payer are to be seized to pay
                                                    the debt. The
                                                    payee's attorney may choose to do the seizing of the assets which
                                                    may be sold at
                                                    auction. At this point if the payer is an organization, then that
                                                    organization
                                                    shall be dissolved and all employees terminated. Then the unpaid
                                                    balance becomes
                                                    the responsibility of the parent organization. If this fine, fee, or
                                                    reward is
                                                    to be paid by an individual, then a year later the employer becomes
                                                    responsible
                                                    and becomes the payer of the fine, fee, or reward via FPS. If the
                                                    employer is
                                                    not a city, then a year later the city having jurisdiction over the
                                                    employer
                                                    becomes the payer. If the employer is a city, then a year later the
                                                    county
                                                    becomes the payer. If the county is the payer, then a year later the
                                                    state
                                                    becomes the payer. No form of bankruptcy has the power to remove

                                                <p>Law of Ryvah 25. In any accusation of attempt or solicitation of a
                                                    crime, (where
                                                    the participation of another person is required) the crime must be
                                                    identified
                                                    with an understanding the attempt or solicitation is a request or

                                                    done will be a crime. This understanding must be known to both
                                                    parties.
                                                    Participation excludes all forced conduct and unwilling conduct. If

                                                    remotely possible the act is not a crime, then the attempt or

                                                    freedom of speech. If a defendant is charged with attempt or
                                                    solicitation and
                                                    the crime has not been identified or there is a remote possibility
                                                    the act is
                                                    not a crime, then the court shall pay the defendant a fine of one

                                                    Identified is to be interpreted as "as a crime" with reasonable
                                                    confidence, not
                                                    absolute proof; thus, a statement by a participant of "I believe

                                                    <p>This law protects freedom of speech by ensuring that charges of

                                                        testimony is to
                                                        the event, the more accurate it is, and by the time it is three
                                                        years away

                                                        and fear can play on the mind. A hundred plus years ago, verbal
                                                        testimony
                                                        was used to convict women of witchcraft under the claim they had
                                                        turned men
                                                        into toads. Obviously it was an error then, just as it is an
                                                        error today to
                                                        trust verbal testimony. People get scared and their minds alter
                                                        what they
                                                        believe to be true. And, we have said nothing of malicious
                                                        intent or greed.
                                                        For these reasons, there must be an absolute statute of
                                                        limitations on the
                                                        admissibility of verbal testimony for the prosecution. If the

                                                        needed to render a guilty verdict was 51% to 49%, more probably
                                                        than not,
                                                        then this law would deny both prosecution and defense from using
                                                        testimony
                                                        over three years old. However, the criteria to reach a guilty
                                                        verdict is 99%
                                                        to 1%. Beyond a reasonable doubt. The defense only needs to
                                                        establish a
                                                        reasonable possibility the crime has not been committed by the
                                                        defendant. It
                                                        is the prosecution who must prove it, and prove it beyond a

                                                        doubt. The idea that verbal testimony of events over three years
                                                        old can

                                                    <p>The concept of defacto law is a relic from a time when people
                                                        could not read.
                                                        Laws were not written, and if they were, they were not written
                                                        clearly. We
                                                        are no longer in an era where the English competency of our

                                                        poor as to need defacto laws. As such we declare all defacto

                                                        clarity as

                                                        attack
                                                        innocent people indiscriminately with callus impunity. With the

                                                        survey ambiguity and vagueness will cripple those laws and force

                                                        will also

                                                    <p>Let us take a look at some of the key points of the survey. I
                                                        expect the
                                                        third party company to survey well over 100 people in an exact
                                                        order. Such
                                                        that, if an individual who took the survey were disqualified,
                                                        there would be
                                                        a backup. So maybe 130 people. Next we reserve the right to redo
                                                        the exact
                                                        same survey. The questions must be identical. Note: It is up to
                                                        the first
                                                        third party company to define the question with the council of
                                                        an attorney,
                                                        probably the defense attorney. The prosecution can do nothing
                                                        but get a new
                                                        batch of people to take it. Of course, if your survey just
                                                        barely hits 94%
                                                        (below 95%) then it is risky to think you will get the same or
                                                        better
                                                        result. A result that would allow you to feel safe doing the act
                                                        described
                                                        in the survey would be closer to 85% with a solid 15% concluding
                                                        it
                                                        ambiguous.</p>

                                                    <p>(Explanation of Law 31 – Pornography)</p>
                                                    <p>A. Child pornography laws first defined child pornography as:
                                                        sexually
                                                        explicit conduct. This sounds pretty good and each of these
                                                        three words
                                                        conveys a powerful meaning. First, sexual: must have something
                                                        to do with
                                                        sex. Second, explicit: a clear and concise understanding – not
                                                        suggestive.
                                                        And third, conduct: Action, not inaction. The sales pitch
                                                        continues with a
                                                        very clear and precise list of extreme actions that further
                                                        restrict the
                                                        definition: genital–genital sex, genital–anal sex, genital–oral
                                                        sex,
                                                        masturbation, bestiality, and the second to last is sadistic or
                                                        masochistic
                                                        abuse. So far so good. At this point I am loving this law. All
                                                        of these
                                                        forms would logically inherit all three conditions of the core
                                                        definition;
                                                        thus they must be explicit and depict conduct. In the case of
                                                        sadistic or
                                                        masochistic abuse, it would inherit sexual also. Therefor, an
                                                        image of a
                                                        child cutting her own arm (masochistic abuse) falls short of
                                                        "sexually
                                                        explicit conduct." Ahhh, but they slipped in one last form: a
                                                        lascivious
                                                        exhibition of the pubic area. Now, Title 18, Section 2256, which
                                                        defines
                                                        child pornography goes to great effort to also define the
                                                        following terms;
                                                        minor, producing, organization, visual depiction, computer,
                                                        graphic, and
                                                        even indistinguishable. However, they have intentionally and
                                                        maliciously
                                                        omitted a definition of lascivious counting on the hope most
                                                        jurors will not
                                                        know what it means. Now, the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines
                                                        lascivious
                                                        as: Lustful -> unbridled sexual desire, or lecherous ->
                                                        inordinate
                                                        indulgence in sexual activity. Oh, but this is not the
                                                        definition the courts
                                                        instruct jury members to use. Because lascivious does not have a
                                                        legal
                                                        definition, the courts think they can fabricate one. The
                                                        fabricated
                                                        definition includes: 1. images that focus on the pubic area or
                                                        have it in
                                                        the center of the image; 2. images that have sexually suggestive

                                                        3. images that have unnatural poses; 4. images that depict
                                                        inappropriate
                                                        attire; 5. Partial nudity or nudity; 6. If the image suggests
                                                        coyness or
                                                        flirtation; 7. If the image is intended to illicit a sexual

                                                        And even if the image had been advertised inappropriately.</p>
                                                    <p>All nine of these considerations would each be considered

                                                        be sexual.
                                                        It no longer needs to be explicit, and it no longer needs to
                                                        depict conduct.
                                                        Worse than that, it circumvents the restriction to the pubic
                                                        area. The law
                                                        says, "lascivious . . . pubic area . . . " Thus, they have
                                                        circumvented the
                                                        restriction to the pubic area. Virtually all images can be

                                                    <p>This law addresses the abuse of prosecutorial discretion, where

                                                        filed not because of clear criminal conduct but to pressure

                                                    <p>Prolonged pretrial detention violates the right to a speedy
                                                        trial, causing
                                                        undue hardship and eroding trust in the judicial system. This

                                                        establishes a clear timeline for trial commencement, penalizing
                                                        courts for
                                                        delays not attributable to the defendant. The escalating fines

                                                    and presented during trial by the defense, then the court shall pay
                                                    a fine of 5
                                                    AIPY for each item prohibited to the defendant via FPS. C. The
                                                    requirements on
                                                    the admissibility of evidence are less strict for the defense than
                                                    the
                                                    prosecution. The prosecution must achieve beyond a reasonable doubt,
                                                    while the
                                                    defense needs only establish plausible deniability. This same
                                                    criterion must
                                                    also apply to evidence to allow a defendant to present the defense
                                                    of their
                                                    choosing. The notion that excessive volume of evidence is
                                                    justification for the
                                                    prohibition of evidence is only applicable after two days of
                                                    presentation or
                                                    eight hours of presentation (whichever is greater) by each single
                                                    witness. With
                                                    this limitation, if any protected evidence is prohibited from being
                                                    introduced
                                                    in trial by the judge, then the judge shall pay a fine to the
                                                    defendant of 10
                                                    AIPY via FPS. Protected evidence must be copied and available to the

                                                    a minimum of one month prior to presentation in trial. Protected
                                                    evidence
                                                    includes: a scientific report or publication, whether written or
                                                    video, where
                                                    the author is clearly identified and possesses a minimum credential
                                                    of a
                                                    bachelor's degree in the topic of the report or publication; a
                                                    published work of
                                                    journalism, whether written or video, where the publisher has a

                                                    greater than 5,000 people; or a document from a hospital, fire

                                                    police department, or government agency. Most importantly, the
                                                    handwritten
                                                    statements of the defendant, where the defendant themselves will
                                                    read them aloud
                                                    to the court while under oath to tell the truth. The prosecution may
                                                    pause this
                                                    reading to immediately cross-examine the defendant at the end of
                                                    each paragraph
                                                    or segment, with the assumption these paragraphs or segments should
                                                    be no
                                                    greater than 150 words. Paragraphs or segments greater than 150
                                                    words may be
                                                    interrupted as needed. Each paragraph or segment must be separated
                                                    by a blank
                                                    line. This is the defendant's reading, and if this is prohibited,
                                                    then there is
                                                    an additional fine of 100 AIPY that shall be paid by the court to
                                                    the defendant

                                                    <p>This law ensures defendants can fully present their understanding
                                                        of laws and
                                                        definitions without judicial obstruction, promoting transparency
                                                        and
                                                        fairness. Part A penalizes courts for prohibiting defendants or

                                                        the defense,

            recordings of all communications with all witnesses and
            potential witnesses, and all
            data on all phones and computers seized. Photos must be a
            minimum of 2,000x1,200 pixels
            and be in color. If the prosecution requests jail video or
            phone recordings, then

            is not incarcerated, then a permanent residence shall have a
            100-foot activation beacon.
            If the tablet is within 100 feet from the beacon, then it

            beacon may be a GPS location. For every day past one week
            the prosecutor has not

                    seized devices—it prevents
                    selective disclosure or manipulation. The requirement
                    for timely delivery within one
                    week, backed by daily fines, compels prosecutors to act
                    swiftly. Special provisions

                <p>This law discourages the use of plea deals, which can be
                    coercive and undermine
                    justice by pressuring innocent defendants to plead
                    guilty out of fear. By fining
                    prosecutors for offering plea deals, it aims to
                    eliminate their use as tools for
                    psychological intimidation or expediency. While plea
                    deals can save time in certain
                    cases, their potential for abuse—convicting the innocent
                    or obscuring the
                    truth—outweighs their benefits. This measure reinforces

                <p>This law eliminates ambiguous or unwritten laws by
                    mandating that undefined legal
                    terms rely solely on definitions from the three most
                    widely sold dictionaries. It

            <h4>(Gender/Race Equality)</h4>
            <p>Law of Ryvah 43. A defendant may contest any consequences
                such as the amount of jail,
                fines, or restrictions they receive for a set of charges. At
                which point, if a defense
                attorney can find ten cases representing similar conduct
                within the last ten years where
                the case had an opposite-gender defendant and, after being
                adjusted for discrepancies
                between the conduct of the cases, the defendant’s jail time,
                fine, or other consequence
                is to be reduced down to the equivalent of the
                opposite-gender amount. Factors that may
                not be considered: trial vs plea deal, age if under 18,
                gender, race, criminal history.
                Factors to be considered are: if the defendant provided
                useful information leading to
                other convictions, the quantity of acts, severity of acts,
                violence, cruelty, abuse of
                authority, significant superior physical power, mental
                disabilities. A case that has
                already had its consequence reduced by this law may not be
                used by this law as one of
                the ten. If a judge does not re-evaluate the consequence
                within one month of the
                submitted petition by the defense attorney, then the judge
                shall pay a fine of one AIPM
                via FPS. This law has no retroactive aspect such that
                convictions that took place prior
                to the enactment of this law cannot be used.</p>

            <h4>(Suspension of Service)</h4>
            <p>Law of Ryvah 51. When a person is incarcerated for more than
                five consecutive days and
                has not been convicted of the crime they are incarcerated
                for, then insurance, loans,
                services, and support payments go into hibernation.
                Hibernation begins retroactively to
                the date of incarceration and ends when it ends (or a
                conviction is levied). During
                hibernation, no interest, fees, or other charges can be
                levied. The service cannot be
                discontinued by the provider. The person cannot be evicted.
                Insurance includes: home,
                auto, medical, theft, vandalism, and life insurance. It
                excludes: workers compensation,
                commercial auto, and business insurance. Loans include: all
                loans initiated over six
                months prior to the incarceration whenever the defendant is
                the only signer, such as a
                home mortgage, vehicle loan, small business loan, and all
                credit card debt. For credit
                card debt, the account must be over six months old, and the
                date of individual charges
                is irrelevant. Services include: electric, water, gas,
                utilities, security, residential
                home maintenance, online services, memberships, newspapers,
                and magazines (which must be
                forwarded to the person’s current address). Support
                includes: alimony, child support,
                and court-ordered payments. Nothing else qualifies as
                support. All hibernation expenses
                are to be paid by the court. If an organization does not
                forward invoices to the court,
                then the organization shall pay a fine to the defendant of
                one dollar via FPS. If the
                court does not pay the expenses that are forwarded to it,

            <h4>(Suspension of Service)</h4>
            <p>Law of Ryvah 51. When a person is incarcerated for more than
                five consecutive days and
                has not been convicted of the crime they are incarcerated
                for, then insurance, loans,
                services, and support payments go into hibernation.
                Hibernation begins retroactively to
                the date of incarceration and ends when it ends (or a
                conviction is levied). During
                hibernation, no interest, fees, or other charges can be
                levied. The service cannot be
                discontinued by the provider. The person cannot be evicted.
                Insurance includes: home,
                auto, medical, theft, vandalism, and life insurance. It
                excludes: workers compensation,
                commercial auto, and business insurance. Loans include: all
                loans initiated over six
                months prior to the incarceration whenever the defendant is
                the only signer, such as a
                home mortgage, vehicle loan, small business loan, and all
                credit card debt. For credit
                card debt, the account must be over six months old, and the
                date of individual charges
                is irrelevant. Services include: electric, water, gas,
                utilities, security, residential
                home maintenance, online services, memberships, newspapers,
                and magazines (which must be
                forwarded to the person’s current address). Support
                includes: alimony, child support,
                and court-ordered payments. Nothing else qualifies as
                support. All hibernation expenses
                are to be paid by the court. If an organization does not
                forward invoices to the court,
                then the organization shall pay a fine to the defendant of
                one dollar via FPS. If the
                court does not pay the expenses that are forwarded to it,

            <h4>(Privacy)</h4>
            <p>Law of Ryvah 57. A subject is one person or one contiguous
                group of people with
                simultaneous interactive communication which is not
                trespassing, stealing, or
                vandalizing and is not in eminent danger due to fire, war,
                or natural disaster. Each
                email, phone call, chat, text message, transaction, and
                conversation constitutes a
                separate subject with privacy. Companies and corporations
                are not subjects. Public
                Service Clause: If an organization contractually requires
                the ability to violate a
                subject’s privacy, it shall pay a fee of one AIPM via FPS
                per month while the subject is
                under contract. If a government or 1,000-strong organization
                invades a subject’s privacy
                without a contract, court order, or probable cause, it shall
                pay a fine of one AIPY via
                FPS per violation. Type A invasions (by non-service
                providers) include photographing on
                private property, recording in private areas, accessing
                unauthorized accounts,
                trespassing, or recording communications. Type B invasions
                (by non-contracted service
                providers) include similar acts plus misuse of recordings.
                Type C invasions (by
                contracted service providers) include accessing unauthorized
                accounts, misusing
                identifiable recordings, or analyzing data beyond service
                provision.</p>

                    categorizes invasions by

            <p>Law of Ryvah 57. A subject is one person or one contiguous
                group of people with
                simultaneous interactive communication which is not
                trespassing, stealing, or
                vandalizing and is not in eminent danger due to fire, war,
                or natural disaster. Each
                email, phone call, chat, text message, transaction, and
                conversation constitutes a
                separate subject with privacy. Companies and corporations
                are not subjects. Public
                Service Clause: If an organization contractually requires
                the ability to violate a
                subject’s privacy, it shall pay a fee of one AIPM via FPS
                per month while the subject is
                under contract. If a government or 1,000-strong organization
                invades a subject’s privacy
                without a contract, court order, or probable cause, it shall
                pay a fine of one AIPY via
                FPS per violation. Type A invasions (by non-service
                providers) include photographing on
                private property, recording in private areas, accessing
                unauthorized accounts,
                trespassing, or recording communications. Type B invasions
                (by non-contracted service
                providers) include similar acts plus misuse of recordings.
                Type C invasions (by
                contracted service providers) include accessing unauthorized
                accounts, misusing
                identifiable recordings, or analyzing data beyond service
                provision.</p>
