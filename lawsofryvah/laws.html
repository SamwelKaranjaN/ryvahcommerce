                <h3>The Laws of Ryvah Preamble</h3>
                <p>Our objective with the Laws of Ryvah is to protect, serve, and defend this great nation; uphold the values of freedom and love; and provide prosperity for all.</p>
                <p>We are compelled to pass these laws because we truly believe all people are created equal with certain unalienable rights which provide life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and these rights are being stripped away, robbed, and dismantled by a government that has become destructive, oppressive, and tyrannical. Our government no longer serves the common welfare of the people. Our government had sabotaged and eroded every constitutional right we hold sacred. The protections our Constitution was designed to afford us have been subverted and in practice are ineffective.</p>
                <p>Our First Amendment grants us the right to, "petition the government for a redress of grievances." The Laws of Ryvah define this redress specifically for every violation of our constitutional rights. Currently we are vulnerable to having our rights severely violated with impunity, and have no effective method for obtaining our just compensation. Not only do the Laws of Ryvah provide just compensation, they take it one step further and prevent the violations of our rights altogether.</p>
                <p>It has proven to be futile to threaten politicians with criminal consequences for violating our rights because they are fundamentally immune to judicial proceedings. It has also been proven to be foolish to expect impeccable moral behavior from our politicians. The Laws of Ryvah do not have these flaws.</p>
                <p>When we comprehend the Declaration of Independence, the U. S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the historical context under which they were written, we can feel the dream our founding fathers had and the love they expressed for the welfare of the people – all of them. The Laws of Ryvah deliver this dream and are written with this love.</p>
                <p>Let us never again be so oppressed we are forced into revolutionary war. If we do not protect the rights our ancestors died to give us, then our children will die to get them back.</p>

                <h4>(Jury Empowerment)</h4>
                <p>Law of Ryvah 1. A jury member must be informed by the judge of the maximum potential punishment of each charge (and collectively as a set of charges) and be asked to consider the potential punishment of a charge or set of charges as one that is appropriate and not excessive for the acts committed; and thus, part of the criteria that must be met or exceeded in order for a jury member to reach a guilty verdict. If a jury member is not informed of the maximum punishment or is not allowed to consider that part of the criteria for a guilty verdict, then the court shall pay a fine to the defendant of 10 AIPY via FPS and each jury member one AIPM via FPS.</p>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <p>(Explanation of 1st Law – Jury Empowerment)</p>
                    <p>We wish to put an end to excessive punishment. The petty theft of a candy bar should never again get life in prison. Yes, again–America was doing this. The politicians have many creative ways to misuse justice and inflict ridiculously excessive punishments. At first such amplifiers as repeat offenders, prison priors, gang enhancements, gun enhancements, hate crime, and many more–they sound good. The idea of filing over thirty charges based on thirty different crimes, also sounds good. Until you get to the jury box when you realize he kissed her thirty times on the date, or there were thirty pictures on his phone, or there were thirty M&M's in the bag of candy.</p>
                    <p>Further, we wish to strip power from the prosecutor and judge and give the power to the jury. The penalty to the prosecutor for attempting to over punish a defendant is to lose. The jury most accurately represents the people, and they are the ones who will ultimately pay the expense of incarceration.</p>
                    <p>Further, we wish to directly associate punishment with the act committed and remove the abstraction of judging guilt by category, then punishment by category. We intend to require all twelve jury members to conclude the punishment fits the crime. We fully intend for jury members to consider their own behavior and opinion on morality; thus, we expect it to be the prosecutor's job to explain why an act is harmful if there are jury members who disagree. We expect jury members to ask more questions along those lines. The jury is currently being used as a scapegoat for horrifically harsh punishment under the mask "the jury convicted him" knowing the jury would not have convicted them had they known what was to happen.</p>

We wish to stop the persecution strategy of bankrupting a defendant with false charges to remove their ability to employ representation for other charges. We wish to remove false accusations. We wish to remove weak and flimsy accusations. We wish to stop the slander of a defendant's character by an abundance of charges with little to no substance. We wish to stop the impact of such secondary issues as publicity, expense of representation, expense of bail, etc.</p>
                    <p>We acknowledge we will need more courthouses, but far fewer prisons. One of the effects of this law is to encourage private attorneys to offer defendants their services with no or little up-front payments. Most, if not all, defendants who have even a slight chance of winning will be able to obtain a private attorney who can dedicate the necessary hours to the case to provide a reasonably good defense with respect to the defendant's situation. There will still be a need for public defenders for cases where there are no private attorneys willing to represent.</p>

                <p>Law of Ryvah 3. Defendants who suffer from chemical intoxication may be detained at a hospital with a doctor's approval. Defendants who suffer from rage may be detained at a mental institution with a doctor's approval. A defendant may not be incarcerated for a charge (or set of charges) that combined carries a maximum sentence of less than three years until after a guilty verdict has been reached, unless the defendant has (an unexcused absence or tardy for court, or has left a hospital or mental institution without a doctor's release) within the past six years. Any agency that violates this law shall pay the defendant a fine of one AIPH for every hour for every charge the defendant is incarcerated via FPS until they are released or a guilty verdict rendered.</p>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <p>(Explanation of 3rd Law – Under Three Years)</p>
                    <p>The fundamental principal we are adhering to is innocent until proven guilty. We recognize a defendant may pose an immediate threat due to drugs or rage. Those defendants need help. They need access to medical and psychiatric care. Further, we intend to fully strip the police from having the power to incarcerate a person. The police are not judges nor jury and shall not be executioner. On the other hand, when a defendant demonstrates they are unwilling to participate in the judicial system (failing to attend court, etc.), then we are left with no alternative. Notice the focus is on small crimes that can render a maximum sentence of less than three years. We will handle more serious charges with the Seventh Law of Ryvah.</p>
                    <p>Further, we intend to empower defendants to be able to acquire a fair trial as required by the U.S. Constitution. We intend for defendants to be free and able to do research and assist in their own defense. We intend to prohibit the demoralization, depression, and desperation intentionally, maliciously, and strategically inflicted on the defendant. The most important goal is to eliminate all scenarios of "time served" where a defendant (even an innocent one) will accept a guilty verdict because they have already served more time than would have been required if they had been guilty. This is the default approach to convictions for small accusations. Our government has millions of these convictions. The majority of people who have been convicted of a crime, and served under six months, are innocent. They did not commit the crime. In fact, most cases take over a year to get to trial, frequently two or three years. The morality of keeping a defendant in jail for three years when they are facing a maximum three year sentence is horrific – well that is where we were as of 2021. And we must correct this.</p>

                <p>Law of Ryvah 4. If law enforcement is not undercover and communicates with a witness (who is not part of law enforcement) more than six hours after the discovery of a potential crime, then they must record the entire communication. If the communication is done in person, then they must video record the witness and officer, and the first thing communicated to the witness must be, "This is being recorded," and the interview must end with, "This concludes our questions." Failure of an officer to comply with this, is an argument a witness has been dissuaded and both the officer's and witnesses's testimony be excluded for that conversation and all other testimony. Copies of all recordings and videos must be delivered to the defense attorney within one week of production or arrest. If law enforcement fails to make or deliver the recordings and videos on time, then the court shall pay a fine to the defendant of one AIPM per recording and video via FPS.</p>

                    <p>No more bribes, threats, or witness coercion. If a witness changes their story, then one story is false and that is very relevant information as to the credibility of the witness. The defendant must have full access to all of this. It has become standard operating procedure for police to offer bribes to witnesses to compel them to lie to convict innocent people. It has also become standard operating procedure for police to threaten witnesses to compel them to lie to convict innocent people. Our goal is to eliminate these unethical practices.</p>

                <h4>(Consent)</h4>
                <p>Law of Ryvah 5. Age of sexual consent is to be determined every ten years by non-biased survey and defined as the age at which twenty-five percent of the surveyed population has voluntarily and intentionally pursued and had any form of physical contact with sexual intent. The survey is to consist only of people of an age within two years of the current age of sexual consent. The survey question shall be: "At what age (did you or do you intend to) voluntarily and intentionally touch any person with the intent to stimulate or gratify the sexual desire of any person?" During (the time prior to the first survey) as well as (if it has been more than ten years without a survey) the age of sexual consent shall decrease by one year per year until reestablished by a survey. If a defendant is arrested for an act made legal by this law the court shall pay a fine to the defendant of 10 AIPY via FPS PA.</p>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <p>(Explanation of 5th Law – Age of Consent)</p>
                    <p>This is the only cultural Law of Ryvah. Thus, it is radically different from all the others. It also serves as a template for all other cultural laws. The rest of the Laws of Ryvah are intended to protect freedom and love for all eternity without any change to the law. By contrast, a cultural law is designed to automatically and dynamically modify itself with the ebb and flow of culture, religion, and science.</p>
                    <p>The key aspect of this template is a reoccurring reevaluation. Every ten years it will be adjusted. The second key aspect is the non-biased survey restricted to the relevant population where the most accurate data can be obtained.</p>
                    <p>The next key aspect is the exact definition of the question (parameter of data collection) and how it will be interpreted. This is important because any wiggle room here could subject the law to manipulation by corrupting the question or how the results will be interpreted. When designing other cultural laws it is important to expect the elite in power are going to attempt to sabotage it.</p>
                    <p>Another key element that is very subtle is the question echoes the exact text of the current laws which regulate that aspect of culture. We want to establish a one-to-one connection. We should be able to claim if you are saying yes to this question, then you are violating the associated criminal law; conversely if you are not, then you are not.</p>
                    <p>The next key element is the motivator clause. This prohibits the avoidance of a survey to circumvent the law in total. If the government wishes to ignore the requirement to host a survey, then it shall be subject to an unpalatable consequence. As for the topic of this template of a cultural law being the age of sexual consent, it is probably the most appropriate topic based on the vast diversity and intense emotional passion/hatred this topic possesses. Other good subjects for cultural laws would be the criminalization of alcohol, drugs, homosexuality, pornography, blasphemy, infidelity, slavery, and many more. All of which could be broken down. For example, many countries have criminalized homosexuality differently for men than for women.</p>
                    <p>Next, to understand how to interpret the data, please notice the question asks for a number(an age. Notice, at 25% we define the age. Observe that extreme numbers are irrelevant. Look at this set of numbers (17, 17, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 9999). In this example our result is 18 which lands on the 25% mark. The fact someone suggested an outlandish 9999 is irrelevant. It is simply one number and has no more weight than any other number. Further we should understand 25% of the population will be in violation of the law. As far as we are concerned, 25% is very arbitrary. The relevance of it is to identify the severity of a violation of the law. As we increase 25% to 30% we decrease the severity of the law. Likewise as we decrease the 25% down to 20% we increase the severity. To put this in perspective, 30% of the population will get a speeding ticket. 5% will get a DUI. 1% will be convicted of a minor felony of less than two years in jail. This forces us to conclude cultural laws do not follow any level of logic or reasonability.</p>

We know in 1945 the U.S. Army used a bare-breasted woman on posters to recruit men for WWII. Since then there has been an agenda to demonize all forms of nudity by the extreme elite.</p>
                    <p>Anyone who is so fearful, offended, or terrified of beholding a fellow member of humanity in the nude as God created Adam and Eve suffers from an extreme psychological disorder caused by this unnatural manipulation and needs to be admitted to a psyche ward for mental correction. The de-normalization of observing nudity has manifested perversions of human sexuality including sodomy, bestiality, sexual sadistic and masochistic abuse, sexual mutilation, sexual violence, and non-biological homosexuality. We observe there has been an enormous increase since 1945 in all of these behaviors. We acknowledge that a small percentage of humanity is biologically homosexual. They are born that way. It matters not how they are raised. We also know many people who claim to be homosexual are not, and it is only a perversion of their true form. Our goal is to once again normalize nudity as it has been for thousands of years.</p>

If a defendant is incarcerated prior to a guilty verdict who (does not have an unexcused absence or tardy from court, and does not have an unauthorized departure from a hospital or mental institution) and is not deemed guilty to all charges, then the court shall pay the defendant a fine of one AIPH for every hour the defendant was incarcerated for each charge that did not receive a guilty verdict via FPS.</p>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <p>(Explanation of 7th Law – Payment for Not Guilty)</p>
                    <p>The goal is innocent until proven guilty. Here it is at the court's discretion/risk to incarcerate a defendant prior to a guilty verdict. Notice, a defendant does not need to be found innocent. It does not matter why a defendant is not found guilty. If the court drops the charges, then the court pays the fine. If the defendant dies, then the court pays the fine. If the defendant gets a hung jury, then the court pays the fine. If a defendant is found guilty on one charge, but not guilty on the second charge, then the court pays the fine on the second charge. Notice, the more charges filed, the more risk is burdened. Each and every charge that does not generate a guilty verdict generates the fine. Our goal is for only legitimate charges to be filed. We also want a conservativeConcerning court. Once a court can guarantee a sentence of thirty or more years, additional charges are moot.</p>
                    <p>As a side note, the practice of a sentence being reduced should be mostly eliminated. Thirty years should be thirty years with something like a 20% discount for good behavior. It is treason to intentionally misinform the public. If a person's minimum sentence is only four years because they will get 33% time and can earn up to six years off for educational programs, then it is unethical to tell the people 30 years (30x33%=10, 10-6=4).</p>
                    <p>It is very important to recognize that 100% of this fine is avoidable. A court never needs to risk a payment. Simply do not incarcerate innocent defendants prior to a guilty verdict. If the court is at all concerned with obtaining a guilty verdict, simply do not put them in jail. That, of course, is the true objective. Jail should be reserved for the guilty.</p>

If a person challenges a law or Presidential Executive Order, or anything by any name that has the power of a law (National Security Council memos for example), as unconstitutional and the court finds that the law or executive order is unconstitutional, obsolete, or unenforceable, then the court shall pay a reward to that person of four AIPY via FPS and the law or order is void–it is not now, nor ever was.</p>
                <p>B. If a judge concludes person is not injured by a government program, Presidential Executive Order, government policy, or law and therefor cannot challenge the constitutionality of it, while the person makes the claim the law threatens to subvert, reduce, or minimize any U.S. citizen's free exercise of their constitutional rights, then that judge must pay the person a fine of ten AIPY vis FPS.</p>

                    <p>(Explanation of 9th Law – Unconstitutional Laws)</p>
                    <p>A. The goal is to remove unconstitutional material (laws, presidential executive orders, etc.) from our country. To succeed we must remove them faster than they are being added. By establishing a substantial financial reward that makes it profitable to challenge laws, we can accomplish this goal. We also wish to simplify the books. Having excessive information increases the difficulty of maintaining a free nation. Laws should be made clear and concise as to leave no room for misinterpretation. It should be agreed that the only requirement to challenge a law is a belief that it is unconstitutional and violates our rights. A person does not need to have been injured by the law. It should not be expected that a person be personally affected by an unconstitutional law to challenge it. For by then it is too late and their rights have been violated. It is our goal to incentivise a radical transformation from oppression to freedom in which anyone can participate. The implementation of this law will dramatically increase public awareness and interest in the matter of knowing what a fair and just government ought to look like and increase public awareness of how far we have diverted from the Constitution. This will shed light on unconstitutional laws that have been passed and shame our current government for allowing it.</p>

        <h2>The Laws of Ryvah</h2>
        <div class="preamble">
            <h3>The Laws of Ryvah Preamble</h3>
            <p>Our objective with the Laws of Ryvah is to protect, serve, and defend this great nation; uphold the values of freedom and love; and provide prosperity for all.</p>
            <p>We are compelled to pass these laws because we truly believe all people are created equal with certain unalienable rights which provide life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and these rights are being stripped away, robbed, and dismantled by a government that has become destructive, oppressive, and tyrannical. Our government no longer serves the common welfare of the people. Our government had sabotaged and eroded every constitutional right we hold sacred. The protections our Constitution was designed to afford us have been subverted and in practice are ineffective.</p>
            <p>Our First Amendment grants us the right to, "petition the government for a redress of grievances." The Laws of Ryvah define this redress specifically for every violation of our constitutional rights. Currently we are vulnerable to having our rights severely violated with impunity, and have no effective method for obtaining our just compensation. Not only do the Laws of Ryvah provide just compensation, they take it one step further and prevent the violations of our rights altogether.</p>
            <p>It has proven to be futile to threaten politicians with criminal consequences for violating our rights because they are fundamentally immune to judicial proceedings. It has also been proven to be foolish to expect impeccable moral behavior from our politicians. The Laws of Ryvah do not have these flaws.</p>
            <p>When we comprehend the Declaration of Independence, the U. S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the historical context under which they were written, we can feel the dream our founding fathers had and the love they expressed for the welfare of the people – all of them. The Laws of Ryvah deliver this dream and are written with this love.</p>
            <p>Let us never again be so oppressed we are forced into revolutionary war. If we do not protect the rights our ancestors died to give us, then our children will die to get them back.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="explanation">
            <h3>Explanation of the Laws</h3>
            <p>These explanations are to explain individual laws, the goals and objectives of a given law, and if a law is not accomplishing its objective or is doing something beyond its intended use, then these explanations are to be used as the groundwork to modify the law to make it do what it is intended to do. It will also provide the historical context and explanation of the problems we wish to solve. This will be true of all explanations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="law">
            <h4>(Jury Empowerment)</h4>
            <p>Law of Ryvah 1. A jury member must be informed by the judge of the maximum potential punishment of each charge (and collectively as a set of charges) and be asked to consider the potential punishment of a charge or set of charges as one that is appropriate and not excessive for the acts committed; and thus, part of the criteria that must be met or exceeded in order for a jury member to reach a guilty verdict. If a jury member is not informed of the maximum punishment or is not allowed to consider that part of the criteria for a guilty verdict, then the court shall pay a fine to the defendant of 10 AIPY via FPS and each jury member one AIPM via FPS.</p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>(Explanation of 1st Law – Jury Empowerment)</p>
                <p>We wish to put an end to excessive punishment. The petty theft of a candy bar should never again get life in prison. Yes, again–America was doing this. The politicians have many creative ways to misuse justice and inflict ridiculously excessive punishments. At first such amplifiers as repeat offenders, prison priors, gang enhancements, gun enhancements, hate crime, and many more–they sound good. The idea of filing over thirty charges based on thirty different crimes, also sounds good. Until you get to the jury box when you realize he kissed her thirty times on the date, or there were thirty pictures on his phone, or there were thirty M&M's in the bag of candy.</p>
                <p>Further, we wish to strip power from the prosecutor and judge and give the power to the jury. The penalty to the prosecutor for attempting to over punish a defendant is to lose. The jury most accurately represents the people, and they are the ones who will ultimately pay the expense of incarceration.</p>
                <p>Further, we wish to directly associate punishment with the act committed and remove the abstraction of judging guilt by category, then punishment by category. We intend to require all twelve jury members to conclude the punishment fits the crime. We fully intend for jury members to consider their own behavior and opinion on morality; thus, we expect it to be the prosecutor's job to explain why an act is harmful if there are jury members who disagree. We expect jury members to ask more questions along those lines. The jury is currently being used as a scapegoat for horrifically harsh punishment under the mask "the jury convicted him" knowing the jury would not have convicted them had they known what was to happen.</p>
                <p>This is linked to the U. S. Constitution through the 7th Amendment which reads, "the right of trial by jury shall be preserved."</p>
                <p>Also the 8th Amendment which reads, "[no] excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."</p>
                <p>Quote, "The history of criminal prosecution is long, bloody, unjust, and downright ludicrous in many cases." – Sean Patrick.</p>

        <div class="law">
            <h4>(Attorney's Fees)</h4>
            <p>Law of Ryvah 2. After a misdemeanor or felony charge against the defendant is resolved without a guilty verdict, the defendant's attorney is to submit a reasonable and complete expense report related to that charge. Those expenses shall be paid by the court to the defendant as a fine via FPS.</p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>(Explanation of 2nd Law – Attorney's Fees)</p>
                <p>We wish to fully reimburse defendants who are not convicted to prohibit monetary attacks. We wish to stop the persecution strategy of bankrupting a defendant with false charges to remove their ability to employ representation for other charges. We wish to remove false accusations. We wish to remove weak and flimsy accusations. We wish to stop the slander of a defendant's character by an abundance of charges with little to no substance. We wish to stop the impact of such secondary issues as publicity, expense of representation, expense of bail, etc.</p>
                <p>We acknowledge we will need more courthouses, but far fewer prisons. One of the effects of this law is to encourage private attorneys to offer defendants their services with no or little up-front payments. Most, if not all, defendants who have even a slight chance of winning will be able to obtain a private attorney who can dedicate the necessary hours to the case to provide a reasonably good defense with respect to the defendant's situation. There will still be a need for public defenders for cases where there are no private attorneys willing to represent.</p>
                <p>This is linked to the U. S. Constitution through the 5th Amendment which reads, "no person shall . . .be deprived of . . . property, without [a conviction]."</p>
                <p>Quote, "The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records. They are written, as with a sunbeam, in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself, and can never be obscured by mortal power." – Alexander Hamilton, 1775</p>

        <div class="law">
            <h4>(Under Three Years)</h4>
            <p>Law of Ryvah 3. Defendants who suffer from chemical intoxication may be detained at a hospital with a doctor's approval. Defendants who suffer from rage may be detained at a mental institution with a doctor's approval. A defendant may not be incarcerated for a charge (or set of charges) that combined carries a maximum sentence of less than three years until after a guilty verdict has been reached, unless the defendant has (an unexcused absence or tardy for court, or has left a hospital or mental institution without a doctor's release) within the past six years. Any agency that violates this law shall pay the defendant a fine of one AIPH for every hour for every charge the defendant is incarcerated via FPS until they are released or a guilty verdict rendered.</p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>(Explanation of 3rd Law – Under Three Years)</p>
                <p>The fundamental principal we are adhering to is innocent until proven guilty. We recognize a defendant may pose an immediate threat due to drugs or rage. Those defendants need help. They need access to medical and psychiatric care. Further, we intend to fully strip the police from having the power to incarcerate a person. The police are not judges nor jury and shall not be executioner. On the other hand, when a defendant demonstrates they are unwilling to participate in the judicial system (failing to attend court, etc.), then we are left with no alternative. Notice the focus is on small crimes that can render a maximum sentence of less than three years. We will handle more serious charges with the Seventh Law of Ryvah.</p>
                <p>Further, we intend to empower defendants to be able to acquire a fair trial as required by the U.S. Constitution. We intend for defendants to be free and able to do research and assist in their own defense. We intend to prohibit the demoralization, depression, and desperation intentionally, maliciously, and strategically inflicted on the defendant. The most important goal is to eliminate all scenarios of "time served" where a defendant (even an innocent one) will accept a guilty verdict because they have already served more time than would have been required if they had been guilty. This is the default approach to convictions for small accusations. Our government has millions of these convictions. The majority of people who have been convicted of a crime, and served under six months, are innocent. They did not commit the crime. In fact, most cases take over a year to get to trial, frequently two or three years. The morality of keeping a defendant in jail for three years when they are facing a maximum three year sentence is horrific – well that is where we were as of 2021. And we must correct this.</p>
                <p>This is linked to the U. S. Constitution through the 5th Amendment which reads, "no person shall . . . be deprived of . . . liberty, . . .without [proof they are evading due process of law]."</p>

        <div class="law">
            <h4>(Testimony)</h4>
            <p>Law of Ryvah 4. If law enforcement is not undercover and communicates with a witness (who is not part of law enforcement) more than six hours after the discovery of a potential crime, then they must record the entire communication. If the communication is done in person, then they must video record the witness and officer, and the first thing communicated to the witness must be, "This is being recorded," and the interview must end with, "This concludes our questions." Failure of an officer to comply with this, is an argument a witness has been dissuaded and both the officer's and witnesses's testimony be excluded for that conversation and all other testimony. Copies of all recordings and videos must be delivered to the defense attorney within one week of production or arrest. If law enforcement fails to make or deliver the recordings and videos on time, then the court shall pay a fine to the defendant of one AIPM per recording and video via FPS.</p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>(Explanation of 4th Law - Testimony)</p>
                <p>No more bribes, threats, or witness coercion. If a witness changes their story, then one story is false and that is very relevant information as to the credibility of the witness. The defendant must have full access to all of this. It has become standard operating procedure for police to offer bribes to witnesses to compel them to lie to convict innocent people. It has also become standard operating procedure for police to threaten witnesses to compel them to lie to convict innocent people. Our goal is to eliminate these unethical practices.</p>
                <p>This is linked to the U. S. Constitution through the 6th Amendment which reads, "the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . trial, by an impartial jury."</p>
                <p>Quote, "the only means to gain one's ends with people are force and cunning. Love, also, they say; but that is to wait for sunshine, and life needs every moment." – Johan von Goethe, 1749-1832. ++ this concept is employed by the secret societies and governments to destroy obstacles indifferent to truth.</p>

            <h4>(Consent)</h4>
            <p>Law of Ryvah 5. Age of sexual consent is to be determined every ten years by non-biased survey and defined as the age at which twenty-five percent of the surveyed population has voluntarily and intentionally pursued and had any form of physical contact with sexual intent. The survey is to consist only of people of an age within two years of the current age of sexual consent. The survey question shall be: “At what age (did you or do you intend to) voluntarily and intentionally touch any person with the intent to stimulate or gratify the sexual desire of any person?” During (the time prior to the first survey) as well as (if it has been more than ten years without a survey) the age of sexual consent shall decrease by one year per year until reestablished by a survey. If a defendant is arrested for an act made legal by this law the court shall pay a fine to the defendant of 10 AIPY via FPS PA.</p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>(Explanation of 5th Law – Age of Consent)</p>
                <p>This is the only cultural Law of Ryvah. Thus, it is radically different from all the others. It also serves as a template for all other cultural laws. The rest of the Laws of Ryvah are intended to protect freedom and love for all eternity without any change to the law. By contrast, a cultural law is designed to automatically and dynamically modify itself with the ebb and flow of culture, religion, and science.</p>
                <p>The key aspect of this template is a reoccurring reevaluation. Every ten years it will be adjusted. The second key aspect is the non-biased survey restricted to the relevant population where the most accurate data can be obtained.</p>
                <p>The next key aspect is the exact definition of the question (parameter of data collection) and how it will be interpreted. This is important because any wiggle room here could subject the law to manipulation by corrupting the question or how the results will be interpreted. When designing other cultural laws it is important to expect the elite in power are going to attempt to sabotage it.</p>
                <p>Another key element that is very subtle is the question echoes the exact text of the current laws which regulate that aspect of culture. We want to establish a one-to-one connection. We should be able to claim if you are saying yes to this question, then you are violating the associated criminal law; conversely if you are not, then you are not.</p>
                <p>The next key element is the motivator clause. This prohibits the avoidance of a survey to circumvent the law in total. If the government wishes to ignore the requirement to host a survey, then it shall be subject to an unpalatable consequence. As for the topic of this template of a cultural law being the age of sexual consent, it is probably the most appropriate topic based on the vast diversity and intense emotional passion/hatred this topic possesses. Other good subjects for cultural laws would be the criminalization of alcohol, drugs, homosexuality, pornography, blasphemy, infidelity, slavery, and many more. All of which could be broken down. For example, many countries have criminalized homosexuality differently for men than for women.</p>
                <p>Next, to understand how to interpret the data, please notice the question asks for a number(an age. Notice, at 25% we define the age. Observe that extreme numbers are irrelevant. Look at this set of numbers (17, 17, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 9999). In this example our result is 18 which lands on the 25% mark. The fact someone suggested an outlandish 9999 is irrelevant. It is simply one number and has no more weight than any other number. Further we should understand 25% of the population will be in violation of the law. As far as we are concerned, 25% is very arbitrary. The relevance of it is to identify the severity of a violation of the law. As we increase 25% to 30% we decrease the severity of the law. Likewise as we decrease the 25% down to 20% we increase the severity. To put this in perspective, 30% of the population will get a speeding ticket. 5% will get a DUI. 1% will be convicted of a minor felony of less than two years in jail. This forces us to conclude cultural laws do not follow any level of logic or reasonability.</p>
                <p>This is linked to the U. S. Constitution through the 1st Amendment which reads, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.”</p>
                <p>Quote, “Conceal your purpose and hide your progress, do not disclose the extent of your designs until they cannot be opposed, until the combat is over. Win the victory before you declare the war.” – Ninon de Lenclos, 1623-1706. ++ in 1957 after WWII, the first age of consent laws took shape under the guidance of the Council of Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission to install a mechanism that could control civil unrest, and remove the leader of an uprising. It had nothing to do with protecting children – that was just a sales pitch.</p>

If a person is arrested for nudity on (private property (where they have permission from the owner or renter to be nude), public beaches (where there are no life guards on duty), public pools (which received funding from the government), or public parks (where the person is more than 100 feet away from a mowed lawn)) indifferent to its vantage point from other locations provided sitting towels are used on chairs and benches on public property, then the court shall pay a fine to the defendant of one AIPY via FPS PA.</p>

                <p>Historically we know the painting “Daybreak” by Maxfield Parish depicting a nude girl was the most popular image on earth in 1925 with reproductions of it found in 25% of all American households. We know in 1945 the U.S. Army used a bare-breasted woman on posters to recruit men for WWII. Since then there has been an agenda to demonize all forms of nudity by the extreme elite.</p>
                <p>Anyone who is so fearful, offended, or terrified of beholding a fellow member of humanity in the nude as God created Adam and Eve suffers from an extreme psychological disorder caused by this unnatural manipulation and needs to be admitted to a psyche ward for mental correction. The de-normalization of observing nudity has manifested perversions of human sexuality including sodomy, bestiality, sexual sadistic and masochistic abuse, sexual mutilation, sexual violence, and non-biological homosexuality. We observe there has been an enormous increase since 1945 in all of these behaviors. We acknowledge that a small percentage of humanity is biologically homosexual. They are born that way. It matters not how they are raised. We also know many people who claim to be homosexual are not, and it is only a perversion of their true form. Our goal is to once again normalize nudity as it has been for thousands of years.</p>

            <p>Law of Ryvah 7. If a defendant is incarcerated prior to a guilty verdict who (does not have an unexcused absence or tardy from court, and does not have an unauthorized departure from a hospital or mental institution) and is not deemed guilty to all charges, then the court shall pay the defendant a fine of one AIPH for every hour the defendant was incarcerated for each charge that did not receive a guilty verdict via FPS.</p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>(Explanation of 7th Law – Payment for Not Guilty)</p>
                <p>The goal is innocent until proven guilty. Here it is at the court’s discretion/risk to incarcerate a defendant prior to a guilty verdict. Notice, a defendant does not need to be found innocent. It does not matter why a defendant is not found guilty. If the court drops the charges, then the court pays the fine. If the defendant dies, then the court pays the fine. If the defendant gets a hung jury, then the court pays the fine. If a defendant is found guilty on one charge, but not guilty on the second charge, then the court pays the fine on the second charge. Notice, the more charges filed, the more risk is burdened. Each and every charge that does not generate a guilty verdict generates the fine. Our goal is for only legitimate charges to be filed. We also want a conservativeConcerning court. Once a court can guarantee a sentence of thirty or more years, additional charges are moot.</p>
                <p>As a side note, the practice of a sentence being reduced should be mostly eliminated. Thirty years should be thirty years with something like a 20% discount for good behavior. It is treason to intentionally misinform the public. If a person’s minimum sentence is only four years because they will get 33% time and can earn up to six years off for educational programs, then it is unethical to tell the people 30 years (30x33%=10, 10-6=4).</p>
                <p>It is very important to recognize that 100% of this fine is avoidable. A court never needs to risk a payment. Simply do not incarcerate innocent defendants prior to a guilty verdict. If the court is at all concerned with obtaining a guilty verdict, simply do not put them in jail. That, of course, is the true objective. Jail should be reserved for the guilty.</p>

                <p>A. The goal is to remove unconstitutional material (laws, presidential executive orders, etc.) from our country. To succeed we must remove them faster than they are being added. By establishing a substantial financial reward that makes it profitable to challenge laws, we can accomplish this goal. We also wish to simplify the books. Having excessive information increases the difficulty of maintaining a free nation. Laws should be made clear and concise as to leave no room for misinterpretation. It should be agreed that the only requirement to challenge a law is a belief that it is unconstitutional and violates our rights. A person does not need to have been injured by the law. It should not be expected that a person be personally affected by an unconstitutional law to challenge it. For by then it is too late and their rights have been violated. It is our goal to incentivise a radical transformation from oppression to freedom in which anyone can participate. The implementation of this law will dramatically increase public awareness and interest in the matter of knowing what a fair and just government ought to look like and increase public awareness of how far we have diverted from the Constitution.

                    <p>(Explanation of 12th Law – Intent)</p>
                    <p>We need to divide this term into two separate terms with radically different meanings. Then we need a clear and concise definition which leaves no room for interpretation. This is our goal. In truth, all legal terms should have such explicit definitions. Our goal here is to sever this term in half. The half that contains malice, violence, force, and is clearly unwanted, keeps the old definition with these new requirements. Truthfully, without these requirements, the old definition is unconstitutional in several ways: 1. Freedom of speech, 2. It is vague, 3. It is over broad, 4. It prohibits the right to pursue happiness.</p>
                <p>The second definition of the term is devoid of malice, violence, force, and is not unwanted. We have to acknowledge an enormous range of behavior by parents, friends, siblings, fans, and behaviors as people mature, experiment, and practice courtship. The selection of a person whom you will have children with is the single most important decision a person will make during their life. Because of this, the infringement must only be at the point where sex could be eminent. To establish sex could be eminent, we qualify the act with “an expectation that as a result of the act sex could occur.” This is not meant to be easy to establish. It is intended to allow a person to cultivate a relation to the point of marriage which would not occur until the subject is legal. This would allow loyalty to be proven, but more importantly, if the relation fails the subject is unharmed and benefits greatly from having it. Truth be told, all of these relations would be expected to end prior to marriage, especially as the age of marriage continues to rise. The benefits to a person who practices social interaction, dating, and courtship are enormous. A second byproduct is well employed and educated breadwinners are likely to comprise the other half of the relation establishing very high expectations in the subject. Losers don’t get to participate.</p>

                <p>Our goal is to remove marriage from government. Marriage is clearly a religious act. Our Constitution states “we shall respect no religion.” Our government has no business using the word marriage, domestic partnership, or any other religious act. There should be no laws that reference either, anywhere, ever. It is the respecting of a religion which has established what amounts to a monetary bribe. A monetary bribe which is at the core a conflict. As soon as we recognize this and remove the bribe, all arguments over marriage will be moot.</p>
                    <p>I have no objection to contracts unless they are verbal. Verbal contracts are prolific with problems, I love marriage contracts that clearly spell out the rights, privileges, obligations, and consequences. A good contract clearly identifies what happens in a breach or termination of contract. It identifies expectations and represents a meeting of the minds were neither party is taking abusive advantage of the other. The government should not pay a man and a woman to enter into a particular contract while failing to pay three men who do the same. One contract should not have benefits and privileges such as survivor benefits or legal immunity for sex acts when other contracts do not. The government should not respect one contract over another, especially when the contract is founded in religious ceremony and structure; that is respecting religion. Imagine if you can, a tax law that paid you $100,000 per year if you were a man with five or more wives. In other words respecting a polygamous religion. Oh, and we will also add that all your wives must be assigned to you by an elder. Such an imaginary law respects religion, violates the Constitution, and cannot be tolerated.</p>

                    <p>(Explanation of 17th Law – Restitution)</p>
                <p>This is to stop a conflict of interest where the more the police steal, the more money they are paid. The idea of seizing money, assets, etc. from convicted defendants after conviction is great, but none of that money can fall into the hands of law enforcement. Not even the expense of collecting and distributing the money can be reimbursed from money taken from defendants. If the law enforcement are unwilling to give the money to the victims, then don’t take it. There can be no exception to this conflict of interest.</p>

                <h4>(Inaction)</h4>
            <p>Law of Ryvah 18. If a defendant is fined, arrested, or incarcerated by law enforcement for inaction (failing to perform a task they have not agreed to perform, failing to purchase a product, or failing to wear a product), then the law enforcement agency shall pay the defendant (one thousand times the fine) and (one AIPM for each day incarcerated) via the FPS PA. Being ordered to “stop” an action, “pull over,” “freeze,” or “drop your weapon,” etc. is to assume a state of inaction; thus excluded. Likewise, preventative orders such as “do not do an action,” are to maintain or assume inaction. If law enforcement, fire protection, or health protection officials make demands and a defendant fails to comply, then that grants the officials the right to use force to protect people, acquire license, and acquire insurance information. Further, termination of employment, licenses, or memberships does not represent a fine. Removing a defendant from private property which the defendant is not leasing or the owner thereof represents protecting the people. Agreeing to perform a task is intended to apply to health and safety responsibilities such as police, fire protection, military, and even baby sitters. The ability for such people to relinquish their agreed upon responsibility is contingent on the ability of someone else taking over. Further, it can never be interpreted a person has agreed to break the law; thus, subject to arrest, etc. for inaction. Further, it is to be interpreted this does not infringe on the publicly accepted policy and practices of law enforcement to control a person who is incarcerated, under arrest, has a warrant for their arrest, or a suspect with sufficient evidence to arrest. Additionally aiding an organization is also excluded. In other words, law enforcement can document your conduct (such as not wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle) and communicate it to an organization which has established a contract you agreed to which established a fine for that conduct.</p>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <p>(Explanation of 18th Law – Inaction)</p>
                    <p>This concept is difficult; inaction is not a crime. Yet, if you agree to take on a responsibility and then do not do it, this is one action over a long stretch of time. It is not inaction. A babysitter is not inactive if she does not intervene to protect the child she is responsible for. Giving birth to a child is an action that lasts 18 years. Getting elected president is an action that lasts four years. My litmus test is a dead body is in a state of total inaction. A dead body can never be held to have broken a law. A dead president immediately relinquishes all his responsibilities; thus, his dead body cannot fail to do something. It has no responsibilities.</p>
                <p>Next we need to acknowledge the need of law enforcement to prevent future actions by ordering a subject to “stop.” This is to err in good faith of law enforcement. While we have a lot of very unethical police who will kill an innocent man, we also have a lot of unethical people who will kill a policeman. If the officer orders you to drop your gun, I don’t care if it’s a cell phone, I don’t care if it will smash on the concrete, you need to release it immediately with your fingers spread apart and your hands away from your body in plain clear view while you yell “yes, sir” in a controlled firm voice of respect and fear acknowledging there may be a law enforcement officer pointing a lethal weapon at you who is already fearful for his life. A defendant who plays games, jokes around, or does not take the situation seriously, has earned the right to die. No part of this law is intended to protect you in situations like this.</p>
                    <p>The next aspect may be even more complex to explain, the use of force as granted by inaction. If you are in a motor vehicle and wish to be inactive, then the officer gains the privilege of removing you from the vehicle. If he cannot locate your lawful privilege of using the roads taxpayers built using taxpayer money where taxpayers established a requirement to be licensed, then your car is getting removed from the road and it will not be allowed to be a threat to the public safety. My advice is to help the officer help you overcome whatever problem you have. If you are on private property, you have a choice, walk off or be dragged off.</p>
                <p>Next the subpoena, this is required. Your rights to inaction do not protect you from the needs of the citizens of this country to compel you to testify as a witness. Honestly, if I could make a dead man talk, I would. Notice that I do not reserve the ability to compel a person to serve on a jury. It is my intention and hope that jury members will be financially compensated for their time based on either minimum wage for the unemployed or 150% of a juror’s established verifiable income.</p>
                    <p>Next the concept of failing to purchase a product is aimed directly at health care. I think a national health care program based on the Oregon plan is a great idea, but it must be funded from the general fund. All health insurance companies must be removed and the medical procedures offered must be based on a cost-to-benefit analysis from greatest ratio of benefits to least. There are to be no levels of care so that congressmen and homeless will receive the exact same care. Requirements for the general population must also be required of all congressmen. If a private individual wants private medical care, (not offered to everyone as part of the national health care program,) then the private individual can pay for it with their own money from a for-profit hospital which does not serve the public. Upon analyzing this we realize no one should be compelled to purchase any product.</p>
                    <p>Next, failing to wear a product; this is obviously aimed at wearing masks in response to Covid -19. We need only contemplate a national dress code that varies by age, gender, and rank where the proud display of religious ideals to a God you do not worship may be required by law. We can never allow this. We can never allow any gateway to this. There can be no exceptions.</p>

If law enforcement takes any action against a person, parent, or child for (failing to take or accept a microchip, vaccine, or any form of medication) or (not doing something which requires a microchip, vaccine, or medication), then the law enforcement or agency shall pay the parent one thousand AIPY via FPS PA. A vaccine is defined here as any medical or psychological procedure or substance administered in any way.</p>
                <p>B. If a government funded school, fire department, or hospital refuses to provide service to a person because they have not received a vaccine, microchip, or medication, then the school, fire department, or hospital shall pay the person a fine of one AIPM via FPS.</p>

                    <p>(Explanation of 19th Law – Vaccines)</p>
                    <p>It is understood that many people believe that vaccines are used to depopulate the world. There is evidence to suggest the aids virus was distributed via vaccine. Many people believe that vaccines are used to dumb down and sedate the population into a state of lethargic apathy and acceptance of an indoctrination into slave labor. It is a fact there is a direct correlation between the administration of vaccines to children and autism in children. We need only look at the cyanide laced Kool-aid the citizens of Jamestown were compelled to drink. To understand the absolute requirement to prohibit any government from compelling the citizens to take any vaccine. This law is intended to prohibit the government from harming the parent or child directly or indirectly. The government cannot require you to drink the Kool-aid in order to keep your job, go shopping, enjoy the park, etc. Restrictions are actions against you. If a government agency is paying a private organization to place restrictions on you, then the government agency is taking an action against you and is subject to the fine. Only a private organization is exempt from this law except as defined in part B.</p>
                    <p>Part B. Focuses on schools, even fully private schools with no government funding. The fine is muchsmaller, but still accomplishes the objective. Also the only act the school is prohibited from doing is refusing to enroll because of a failure to take the vaccine. It is intentionally watered down.</p>

                <p>Freedom of speech is one of our most precious rights. Dolls (and their many forms) are a branch of art and freedom of speech. There are agendas to criminalize them. There is already legislation in other countries to outlaw certain types of dolls. This type of an attack uses parental fear with the association of horrific crime. They fabricate a crisis. They find some innocent little girl, and they claim the monster had possession of (something they want to outlaw) in this case, dolls. They launch an elaborate advertising campaign to persuade the public the dolls caused the horrific crime and the only way to protect the public is to outlaw the dolls. At first they will outlaw only a very specific type of doll, something nobody really cares about. Once the community has accepted this, then the definition will be expanded until all dolls are a crime. To see this progression in implementation you need only watch public TV when they depict the statue of David (a doll) which is the iconic symbol of the nation of Italy. Notice how they censor out his mid-section. If you are an Italian, you should be angry. If you are an American, you should be angry. If you are a human, you should be angry. No doll can ever be classified as a crime.</p>

            <p>Law of Ryvah 21. When a government agency or private company under the authority of a government agency takes possession of personal property from a known person (including under a search warrant), then if (the property has not been returned to the person within three months of the date taken) and (the property has not been determined to be illegal by: a chemical analysis in the case of drugs, chemicals, or medicine; a judge’s assessment in the case of weapons possessed by convicted felons, counterfeit money, stolen property when the true owner can be identified, and something produced by the commission of a crime; and a jury trial in the case of weapons owned by non-felons, pornography, something specifically used in the commission of a crime, and piracy or counterfeit products), then that government agency or private company shall pay a fine of (10% of the fair market value of vehicles; 10% the replacement cost of tools, computers, machinery, dishes, clothing, children’s toys, furniture, appliances, and bedding; 10% of the appraised value of antiques, artwork, jewelry, fossils, and mineral specimens; 10% of US currency, stocks, and bonds; and 10% of market value of silver and gold) per month to the owner of the property via FPS. Appraisals must be provided for items needing appraisal and can be attached to the item. The appraisal can be submitted at any point in time by an attorney or the owner of the property; however, the value is to be assessed at zero until the appraisal of the item has been sent by certified mail. Documentation of the purchase price can serve as an appraisal at its purchase price. In order for an appraisal to be valid it must be from a company in the business related to the item. (Antiques, art, jewelry, or fossils and minerals, etcetera), and include the name and contact information of the appraiser. Possessions or personal property seized from incarcerated persons may be returned by placing said property in property-in-storage for the inmate upon release.</p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>(Explanation of 21st Law – Return Property)</p>
                <p>We are focusing on innocent until proven guilty and the right to a fair trial which requires the ability to defend yourself. By taking a person’s assets, the police can inflict extreme hardship, financial loss and expense, and deny a defendant the ability to defend themselves. If you take their car, they can’t go to work or must rent or purchase a new car. The same is true of many things. If the police take enough, they can completely cripple a person: no phone, no computer, no car, no furniture, no dishes, no clothing. Do you get it yet? Our goal is to force the police to simply return the property.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately it is not that easy. There is some stuff we do not want them to return. Obviously we will not return the money they stole from the bank, but how do we determine this? So we defined categories: chemist, judge, jury, everything else. Each of these four categories cover a specific type of property. A chemist is obvious; we use a professional expert to make the determination. The three remaining are a scale of easy, hard, and very hard. A judge’s assessment is easy. “Hey judge, we don’t want to return this,” – prosecutor. “Okay, what’s the excuse?” – Judge. As a result, this is a very narrow list, not just a weapon, but one owned by a convicted felon. Notice counterfeit money is here, but counterfeit products are not. Money is intended to include money orders, bank checks, stamps, stocks and other currencies which are counterfeit. This is key. It in no way covers real money, real money orders, real bank checks, real stamps, etc. Of course the next item is stolen property where the true owner can be identified. Thus, a thief with a hundred dollars (even if you know he stole the money, but you don’t know who from), the police cannot keep it. Why? Because if you don’t know who it was taken from, then the truth is you don’t know it was stolen. I now envision a scenario where the police bust a ring and seize a truckload of stolen property from hundreds of unidentified victims. Well the police have three months to identify as many as they can. This is intentional. As a victim, I want my property back. I envision a lost & found style police recovery website where victims can identify stolen property and search the database.</p>
                <p>Next, “something produced by the commission of a crime.” Money is produced by the crime of selling illegal stuff. The bookkeeping records, not the computer, are produced: however, if these records cannot be moved onto another computer, then the computer gets sucked in. This is like ink on paper. If I can’t keep the ink without keeping the paper, then the police get to keep the paper. Of course, there is this mysterious and magical device called a copy machine that I could claim allows the police to keep the data and return the paper. Property that was theoretically purchased with money which was produced by the commission of a crime is not a product of the crime. It is only indirectly connected.</p>
                <p>The next category is very hard: by a jury trial. This would require the prosecution to bring the case to trial within three months or start paying rent, or photograph documents and return the property with a lean to seize it again upon the determination of a jury. The right to bear arms puts weapons owned by non-felons in this category. All forms of pornography and child pornography fall into this category. I trust no judge with the capacity to know the difference between legal and illegal art. Something specifically used in the commission of a crime, this is strange because it would include the murder weapon, this sounds ridiculous until you do the math: A baseball bat – $7, a kitchen knife – $5, a handgun – $200. What is 10% of $200? Well $20. The conviction of an average gun charge will cost society between $100,000 and $300,000. If the object is important, simply pay the rent. Even a couple hundred dollars in rent is perfectly acceptable. Oh, but now we have a solid precedent that benefits the defendant and irrelevant property is not economical to keep nor does keeping the property sabotage the defendant’s ability to function. I also want to point out if the police do their job and get the case to trial within three months, none of this matters.</p>

    <h4>(FPS)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 24. FPS = the Fine Payment Standard. When a person or organization is required to pay a fine, fee, or reward to a payee, the payee’s attorney shall submit an invoice to the payer via certified mail. The attorney shall continue to send monthly statements to the payer. The payer shall pay the payee’s attorney who will deduct for unpaid services rendered and then pay the balance to the payee within 30 days.</p>
    <p>The payment to the payee is not considered income and is not subject to any form of tax.</p>
    <p>There is an additional fee of 4% on the unpaid balance every month (thus approximately 82% APR). This four percent fee applies to both the payer and the payee’s attorney. If after each year, the fine, fee, or reward has not been paid in full, then all the assets of the payer are to be seized to pay the debt. The payee’s attorney may choose to do the seizing of the assets which may be sold at auction. At this point if the payer is an organization, then that organization shall be dissolved and all employees terminated. Then the unpaid balance becomes the responsibility of the parent organization. If this fine, fee, or reward is to be paid by an individual, then a year later the employer becomes responsible and becomes the payer of the fine, fee, or reward via FPS. If the employer is not a city, then a year later the city having jurisdiction over the employer becomes the payer. If the employer is a city, then a year later the county becomes the payer. If the county is the payer, then a year later the state becomes the payer. No form of bankruptcy has the power to remove this debt or prevent the seizing of assets or the escalation of the debt to the parent organization.</p>
    <p>If the invoice is contested by the payer, then the interest on the invoice will accrue from the date of the invoice, not the date of the judgement of the validity of the invoice.</p>
    <p>If the payment is to be paid to every US citizen, then any attorney at law from each state may submit the invoice and distribute payment to each of the US citizens within the one-and-only-one state they represent. No attorney or law firm may invoice for more than one state. The payer must pay only one invoice from each state and must send a letter via certified mail to all other attorneys from that state, identifying the attorney who was paid, the date payment was made, the check number or tracking number of the payment, and the amount paid.</p>
    <p>If the act causing the fine, fee, or reward was done in the interest of national security, then the fine, fee, or reward is quadrupled.</p>
    <p>A successful appeal indicates the judge who presided over trial failed to do their job and that judge shall pay a fine to the defendant of one AIWY via FPS. Further, a successful appeal removes a guilty verdict and thus all other FPS fines that would have taken place are also applicable.</p>
    <p>PA = Plus Associates: the arresting officer shall pay an additional fine to the defendant of one AIPY via FPS. Further the politician(s) if alive, or the estates thereof if one exists, who authored the law being used to make the arrest shall also pay a fine to the defendant of one AIPY via FPS.</p>
    <p>AIPY = the average income per capita for one year.</p>
    <p>AIPM= one twelfth the AIPY. (one month)</p>
    <p>AIPW= one 50th the AIPY. (week)</p>
    <p>AIPD = one fifth the AIPW. (day)</p>

        <p>(Explanation of 24th Law – FPS)</p>
        <p>The Fine Payment Standard (FPS) establishes a robust mechanism to ensure fines, fees, or rewards mandated by the Laws of Ryvah are paid promptly and fairly. By requiring payment through certified mail invoices and imposing a high interest rate on unpaid balances, this law discourages delays or evasion by payers, including government entities or individuals. The escalation of responsibility to higher entities (employer, city, county, state) ensures accountability, while the non-taxable nature of payments protects the payee’s compensation. The quadrupling of fines for national security-related violations targets potential abuses under such pretexts. The PA clause extends liability to arresting officers and lawmakers, aligning their personal accountability with the enforcement of unjust laws.</p>

    <h4>(Solicitation)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 25. In any accusation of attempt or solicitation of a crime, (where the participation of another person is required) the crime must be identified with an understanding the attempt or solicitation is a request or offer which if done will be a crime. This understanding must be known to both parties. Participation excludes all forced conduct and unwilling conduct. If it is even remotely possible the act is not a crime, then the attempt or solicitation is freedom of speech. If a defendant is charged with attempt or solicitation and the crime has not been identified or there is a remote possibility the act is not a crime, then the court shall pay the defendant a fine of one AIPY via FPS. Identified is to be interpreted as “as a crime” with reasonable confidence, not absolute proof; thus, a statement by a participant of “I believe that is a crime” adequately identifies and provides understanding. Prior to such a statement, understanding cannot be established, and after it, understanding is proven.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 25th Law – Solicitation)</p>
        <p>This law protects freedom of speech by ensuring that charges of attempt or solicitation of a crime are only valid when both parties clearly understand the act as criminal. By requiring explicit identification of the crime and mutual understanding, it prevents vague or ambiguous accusations that could criminalize innocent conversations or negotiations. The exclusion of forced or unwilling conduct safeguards against entrapment or coercion. The fine for improper charges deters prosecutorial overreach, reinforcing the principle that speech, unless explicitly tied to a known crime, remains protected.</p>

    <h4>(Verbal Testimony)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 26. Verbal testimony of events more than three years in the past from when the testimony is given is inadmissible for the prosecution. Video recorded and created within three years remains admissible; however, the witness is still required to appear during trial for cross examination by the defense. In this case the prosecution will not be permitted to question the witness during trial. If the prosecution asks the witness a question about events over three years in the past, or video recorded testimony is presented without the opportunity for the defense to cross examine the witness, then the court is to pay the defendant a fine of five AIPY via FPS and the prosecutor is to pay a fine to the defendant of one AIPY via FPS.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 26th Law – Verbal Testimony)</p>
        <p>Verbal testimony is the least creditable type of evidence that is admissible in a trial. It changes on a whim and is frequently for sale to the highest bidder. Further, it deteriorates over time. The closer the testimony is to the event, the more accurate it is, and by the time it is three years away from the event it cannot be trusted. Compounding this is the impact emotions and fear can play on the mind. A hundred plus years ago, verbal testimony was used to convict women of witchcraft under the claim they had turned men into toads. Obviously it was an error then, just as it is an error today to trust verbal testimony. People get scared and their minds alter what they believe to be true. And, we have said nothing of malicious intent or greed. For these reasons, there must be an absolute statute of limitations on the admissibility of verbal testimony for the prosecution. If the criteria needed to render a guilty verdict was 51% to 49%, more probably than not, then this law would deny both prosecution and defense from using testimony over three years old. However, the criteria to reach a guilty verdict is 99% to 1%. Beyond a reasonable doubt. The defense only needs to establish a reasonable possibility the crime has not been committed by the defendant. It is the prosecution who must prove it, and prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. The idea that verbal testimony of events over three years old can meaningfully and credibly add to the prosecution’s case is wrong.</p>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 27th Law – Judges)</p>
        <p>A judge who had more time as a prosecuting attorney than as a defense attorney is biased in favor of the prosecution and no longer requires the establishment of beyond a reasonable doubt.

    <p>Law of Ryvah 28. A. If law enforcement misinforms a juror, witness or defendant of the law or their rights, then the law enforcement officer must pay that juror, witness, or defendant a fine of one AIPW via FPS.</p>
    <p>B. If law enforcement threatens a witness or potential witness to coerce them to testify against a defendant, talk to law enforcement, or file any form of court order, then the law enforcement officer must pay a fine to both the (witness or potential witness) and the defendant of one AIPW via FPS.</p>
    <p>C. If law enforcement implies or provides information to a witness or potential witness that a defendant has enough money that the witness or potential witness could sue the defendant to get money, then the law enforcement shall pay a fine to both the (witness or potential witness) and the defendant of one AIPW via FPS each.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 28th Law – Coercion)</p>
        <p>A. The term “their” is reflexive back on the juror, witness, or defendant and is specific to them. In other words, if a witness is misinformed of the witness’s rights, if a juror is misinformed of the juror’s rights, if a defendant is misinformed of the defendant’s rights, – it is not the cartesian product. Our goal here is to stop coercion, stop the malicious lies about what the law actually says, and to punish those who spread the lies.</p>
        <p>B. No more threats. A threat is a consequence which causes harm. The statement, “If you don’t file a restraining order against that man, I’m going to get CPS involved and they may take your child,” should be answered with, “Will you be paying your fine with cash, check, or charge?” Never talk to a law enforcement officer without a hidden recorder.</p>

    <h4>(Term Limits)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 29. For every year and every employee a government agency employs a person in the field of law enforcement (to include: police, sheriffs, deputies, and prosecutors; while excluding defense attorneys, private investigators, medical staff, psychiatric staff, and unpaid volunteers) over fifteen years total during that person’s life the government agency is to pay the defendant who was arrested by, searched by, detained by, given a ticket or citation by, processed by, questioned by, prosecuted by, or presided over by, a fine of one AIPM via FPS.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 29th Law – Term Limits)</p>
        <p>Real simple, this imposes a 15 year term limit on the sum of time as a policeman, sheriff, deputy, judge, and prosecutor. Time as a defense attorney, private investigator, etc. Does not add to the sum. I cannot really envision a job as policeman where they never arrested, investigated, searched, detained, ticketed, processed, questioned, prosecuted, or presided over a defendant, but just in case someone else can, the intent is to include them, too. After 15 years they need to find a new job.</p>

    <h4>(One Hundred Person Survey)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 30. A person or defense attorney may employ a professional third party company to perform a one-hundred person survey on the clarity of a precise law or aspect of law as it applies to a precise act or product. The people taking the survey must be over 18 years old, not suffer from any mental disability, speak English fluently, be a U. S. citizen, and be unbiased and selected randomly.</p>
    <p>Then if (this precise law or aspect of law is required to be met in order for the person to be deemed guilty) and (the survey concludes the act or product does not clearly meet the criteria of the law or aspect of law by at least 95% of the people surveyed).</p>
    <p>Then if said person is arrested, the prosecution or judge has one month to redo the exact same survey after the defense has provided their survey.</p>
    <p>If (a new survey is not done or the new survey concludes the act or product does not clearly meet the criteria by 95%), and the charges are not dropped, then the court shall pay the defendant ten AIPY per charge via FPS.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 30th Law – One Hundred Person Survey)</p>
        <p>The concept of defacto law is a relic from a time when people could not read. Laws were not written, and if they were, they were not written clearly. We are no longer in an era where the English competency of our lawmakers is so poor as to need defacto laws. As such we declare all defacto laws null and void.</p>
        <p>Fundamentally, the 100 person survey holds all law to a level of clarity as to be understood by a minimum of 95% of the people who read them. Before Ryvah, the ambiguity and vagueness of law empowered the law to attack innocent people indiscriminately with callus impunity. With the 100 person survey ambiguity and vagueness will cripple those laws and force the law makers to write them with clear and concise language. Of course, that will open them up for Constitutional challenges where the law depends on ambiguity to hide its unconstitutionality. The 100 person survey will also be instrumental in conjunction with challenging a law by establishing what people think it means.</p>
        <p>Let us take a look at some of the key points of the survey. I expect the third party company to survey well over 100 people in an exact order. Such that, if an individual who took the survey were disqualified, there would be a backup. So maybe 130 people. Next we reserve the right to redo the exact same survey. The questions must be identical. Note: It is up to the first third party company to define the question with the council of an attorney, probably the defense attorney. The prosecution can do nothing but get a new batch of people to take it. Of course, if your survey just barely hits 94% (below 95%) then it is risky to think you will get the same or better result. A result that would allow you to feel safe doing the act described in the survey would be closer to 85% with a solid 15% concluding it ambiguous.</p>

    <h4>(Pornography)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 31. A. If person is arrested for an image that does not depict explicit sexual (vaginal, anal, oral, or genital) (intercourse, masturbation, or sadistic or masochistic abuse) or an explicit depiction of the (pubic area, genitals, or anus) with any substance indicating lascivious (post sexual intercourse or ejaculation), then the court is to pay a fine to the defendant of 10 AIPY via FPS.</p>
    <p>B. If a government agency uses any form of the word pornographic referring to content that is not an image which depicts explicit sexual (vaginal, anal, oral, or genital) (intercourse, masturbation, or sadistic or masochistic abuse) or an explicit depiction of the (pubic area, genitals, or anus) with any substance indicating lascivious (post sexual intercourse or ejaculation), then that agency must pay a fine of one AIPY per reference to the owner of the content via FPS.</p>
    <p>C. If law enforcement informs a person that a given image or type of image is illegal when it is not, then the law enforcement officer must pay that person a fine of one AIPY via FPS.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of Law 31 – Pornography)</p>
        <p>A. Child pornography laws first defined child pornography as: sexually explicit conduct. This sounds pretty good and each of these three words conveys a powerful meaning. First, sexual: must have something to do with sex. Second, explicit: a clear and concise understanding – not suggestive. And third, conduct: Action, not inaction. The sales pitch continues with a very clear and precise list of extreme actions that further restrict the definition: genital–genital sex, genital–anal sex, genital–oral sex, masturbation, bestiality, and the second to last is sadistic or masochistic abuse. So far so good. At this point I am loving this law. All of these forms would logically inherit all three conditions of the core definition; thus they must be explicit and depict conduct. In the case of sadistic or masochistic abuse, it would inherit sexual also. Therefor, an image of a child cutting her own arm (masochistic abuse) falls short of “sexually explicit conduct.” Ahhh, but they slipped in one last form: a lascivious exhibition of the pubic area. Now, Title 18, Section 2256, which defines child pornography goes to great effort to also define the following terms; minor, producing, organization, visual depiction, computer, graphic, and even indistinguishable. However, they have intentionally and maliciously omitted a definition of lascivious counting on the hope most jurors will not know what it means. Now, the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines lascivious as: Lustful -> unbridled sexual desire, or lecherous -> inordinate indulgence in sexual activity. Oh, but this is not the definition the courts instruct jury members to use. Because lascivious does not have a legal definition, the courts think they can fabricate one. The fabricated definition includes: 1. images that focus on the pubic area or have it in the center of the image; 2. images that have sexually suggestive settings; 3. images that have unnatural poses; 4. images that depict inappropriate attire; 5. Partial nudity or nudity; 6. If the image suggests coyness or flirtation; 7. If the image is intended to illicit a sexual response in the viewer; 8. If the customer might use the image for sexual gratification; 9. And even if the image had been advertised inappropriately.</p>
        <p>All nine of these considerations would each be considered unconstitutionally over broad and a clear violation of our First Amendment rights which is why they have been omitted from the definition of child pornography. They are intentionally evading a constitutional challenges. You need to fully realize with this definition a child need not be nude. Any image that meets any one of these considerations can be called pornographic. People are being convicted of child pornography for photos of fully clothed children on playgrounds. They are being convicted for child pornography for photos of children in swimsuits. People are being convicted for photos of children in clothing that does not fit right, people are being convicted for photos of sleeping children. These nine considerations have fully circumvented every aspect of sexually explicit conduct. An image no longer needs to be sexual. It no longer needs to be explicit, and it no longer needs to depict conduct. Worse than that, it circumvents the restriction to the pubic area. The law says, “lascivious . . . pubic area . . .” Thus, they have circumvented the restriction to the pubic area. Virtually all images can be deemed pornographic. Now if you’re not scared yet, let me convey to you the Muslim religion is over a billion strong globally and is the fastest growing religion in America and we could see a point where all photos of children not in a full burka are deemed child pornography and all your family photos deleted from all the genealogy databases, effectively removing you from history.</p>
        <p>Is this an over reaction? Are we really at risk of all child beauty pageants, gymnastics, and home dance videos being classed as child pornography? Consider these facts. In 1925 the painting by Maxfield Parish “Day Break”, which depicts a full nude ten-year-old girl was so widely accepted and loved a reproduction of the image was in 25% of all American households, making it the most poplar image of its time. Child nudity was simply commonplace. By 1945 it had diminished only slightly and the US military used an image of a bare-breasted woman to recruit soldiers for the war and junior high schools still hosted plays of Adam and Eve where the two junior high school students were nude in front of family, classmates, and faculty. In 1970-71 the famous photo from the Viet Nam war of a ten-year-old full frontal nude girl was on the front page of the New York Times newspaper and won a Pulitzer Prize. In 1978, the child pornography laws were passed. In 1986, United States V. Dost was the first use of the nine considerations. In 2020 the implementation is so unconstitutionally broad, just about anything can fall into its jaws. The progress is very clear. Because the last four generations failed to protect their freedoms, they were taken away.</p>
        <p>B. This is intended to prohibit the misuse of the word and prohibit its erosion, it would cover porn, porno, pornographic, pornography, the plural form of these words, and all compound phrases including one of these words.</p>
        <p>C. First, only lawyers can give legal advice. We must stop the lies and malicious misinformation which is eroding our freedom of speech.</p>

    <h4>(Prosecutorial Discretion)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 32. If a prosecutor files charges against a defendant for an act that a reasonable person would not consider a crime based on the plain language of the law, or if the charges are filed to intimidate or coerce the defendant into a plea deal, then the prosecutor must pay a fine to the defendant of five AIPY via FPS. The defendant’s attorney may request a judicial review to determine if the charges meet this criterion, and the court shall rule within 14 days.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 32nd Law – Prosecutorial Discretion)</p>
        <p>This law addresses the abuse of prosecutorial discretion, where charges are filed not because of clear criminal conduct but to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals out of fear of excessive punishment. The requirement for a judicial review ensures an impartial check on prosecutorial overreach. By imposing a significant fine, this law deters prosecutors from using their authority to harass or intimidate, reinforcing the principle that justice must be based on reason and evidence, not coercion. The 14-day ruling period ensures swift resolution to prevent prolonged harm to the defendant.</p>

        <p>(Explanation of 35th Law – Speedy Trial Enforcement)</p>
        <p>Prolonged pretrial detention violates the right to a speedy trial, causing undue hardship and eroding trust in the judicial system. This law establishes a clear timeline for trial commencement, penalizing courts for delays not attributable to the defendant.

    <h4>(Presenting Evidence)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 36. A. Every time a defendant is asked about their understanding of a law or the definition of a word and then prohibited by the judge from answering the question in part or whole, including referencing the exact law or dictionary definition, then the court shall pay a fine to the defendant of one AIPY via FPS. This includes prohibiting a copy of the law, dictionary, or examples of non-violations of the law. Each law, dictionary, and example will generate the fine. If a defense attorney is prohibited from asking the defendant or witness about their understanding of a law or definition of a word, then the court shall pay a fine to both the defendant and defense attorney of one AIPY each via FPS. If a defense attorney is arrested or charged an amount of money for asking, attempting to ask, or requesting to ask the defendant about their understanding of the law or definition of a word, then the court shall pay the defense attorney a fine of 100 times the charge and 100 AIPY via FPS. If the defense attorney is suspended or disbarred as a result of any of these actions, then the state shall pay a fine to the defense attorney of 1,000 AIPY via FPS. B. If a witness takes the stand or any statement from the witness is used as evidence, and a video, audio recording, handwritten statement, or any digital communication of/by the witness is prohibited from being entered into evidence and presented during trial by the defense, then the court shall pay a fine of 5 AIPY for each item prohibited to the defendant via FPS. C. The requirements on the admissibility of evidence are less strict for the defense than the prosecution. The prosecution must achieve beyond a reasonable doubt, while the defense needs only establish plausible deniability. This same criterion must also apply to evidence to allow a defendant to present the defense of their choosing. The notion that excessive volume of evidence is justification for the prohibition of evidence is only applicable after two days of presentation or eight hours of presentation (whichever is greater) by each single witness. With this limitation, if any protected evidence is prohibited from being introduced in trial by the judge, then the judge shall pay a fine to the defendant of 10 AIPY via FPS. Protected evidence must be copied and available to the prosecution a minimum of one month prior to presentation in trial. Protected evidence includes: a scientific report or publication, whether written or video, where the author is clearly identified and possesses a minimum credential of a bachelor’s degree in the topic of the report or publication; a published work of journalism, whether written or video, where the publisher has a circulation of greater than 5,000 people; or a document from a hospital, fire department, police department, or government agency. Most importantly, the handwritten statements of the defendant, where the defendant themselves will read them aloud to the court while under oath to tell the truth. The prosecution may pause this reading to immediately cross-examine the defendant at the end of each paragraph or segment, with the assumption these paragraphs or segments should be no greater than 150 words. Paragraphs or segments greater than 150 words may be interrupted as needed. Each paragraph or segment must be separated by a blank line. This is the defendant’s reading, and if this is prohibited, then there is an additional fine of 100 AIPY that shall be paid by the court to the defendant via FPS. When an exact physical object or data file in the possession of either the prosecution or defense is specifically referenced in the defendant’s reading and is then requested by the jury, it shall be provided as evidence for the jury to inspect.</p>

        <p>This law ensures defendants can fully present their understanding of laws and definitions without judicial obstruction, promoting transparency and fairness. Part A penalizes courts for prohibiting defendants or their attorneys from referencing laws, dictionaries, or examples, ensuring clarity in legal proceedings. Severe fines for arresting or disbarring attorneys protect zealous advocacy. Part B safeguards the defense’s right to present evidence that discredits witnesses, countering false or inconsistent testimony. Part C establishes a lower evidentiary threshold for the defense, recognizing the prosecution’s higher burden of proof. It protects specific types of evidence, especially the defendant’s own statements, to ensure their narrative is heard. These measures prevent judicial overreach and uphold the defendant’s right to a fair defense, prioritizing justice over procedural barriers.</p>

    <h4>(Speedy Trial)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 37. A. If a defendant has no unexcused absences or tardies for court in the last six years, then for every day past 90 days after a competent defendant has waived time (or from the point of arrest) or two years after a defendant has been deemed incompetent, the court has not resolved a charge or started trial, the court shall pay a fine to the defendant of one AIPW via FPS. B. The statute of limitations on all crimes cannot exceed one year plus the maximum punishment of the crime. If a defendant is arrested for a crime beyond this limit, then the court shall pay the defendant a fine of two AIPY per charge via FPS.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 37th Law – Speedy Trial)</p>
        <p>This law strengthens the right to a speedy trial by imposing strict timelines and penalties for delays. Part A fines courts for failing to resolve charges or start trials within 90 days for competent defendants or two years for incompetent ones, provided the defendant has a clean attendance rekord. This prevents prolonged detention without progress. Part B limits statutes of limitations to one year plus the crime’s maximum punishment, penalizing arrests beyond this period. These measures protect defendants from indefinite legal limbo, ensuring timely justice and deterring prosecutorial procrastination that undermines fair trials.</p>

    <h4>(Discovery)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 38. For all discovery of a given defendant upon a written request by the defense attorney or any request made in court by the defendant or defense attorney, the prosecutor shall provide to the defendant a tablet, and to the defendant’s attorney (if different) a digital copy. The tablet and digital copy will contain all discovery including: photos of all physical evidence, photos of all property seized, all recordings of all communications with all witnesses and potential witnesses, and all data on all phones and computers seized. Photos must be a minimum of 2,000x1,200 pixels and be in color. If the prosecution requests jail video or phone recordings, then everything provided to the prosecution is also part of discovery. All reports from psychiatric staff given to the prosecutor are also part of discovery. For the tablet, the prosecution may redact text (containing last names, addresses, contact information, identification information such as SSN or DMV numbers) for/of victims. Property which has been returned and which will not be referenced by the prosecution during trial is excluded. There will be no methods of removing the files from the tablet. The tablet will include a charger. If the defendant is incarcerated, then their cell must be equipped with power such that they can use the tablet 24 hours a day. If the defendant is not incarcerated, then a permanent residence shall have a 100-foot activation beacon. If the tablet is within 100 feet from the beacon, then it must be able to power on. The beacon may be a GPS location. For every day past one week the prosecutor has not delivered the above-described discovery, the prosecutor shall pay a fine to the defendant of one AIPW via FPS.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 38th Law – Discovery)</p>
        <p>This law ensures complete transparency in the discovery process, granting defendants and their attorneys full access to all evidence available to the prosecution. By mandating a tablet with unalterable, high-quality digital copies of evidence—including photos, recordings, and data from seized devices—it prevents selective disclosure or manipulation. The requirement for timely delivery within one week, backed by daily fines, compels prosecutors to act swiftly. Special provisions for tablet access, such as 24-hour power for incarcerated defendants or a 100-foot activation beacon for those not in custody, ensure practical usability. This law upholds the defendant’s right to be fully informed, leveling the playing field and safeguarding against prosecutorial misconduct.</p>

    <h4>(Plea Deals)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 40. If a prosecutor offers a defendant or defense attorney a plea deal, then the prosecution shall pay a fine to the defendant of one AIPY via FPS.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 40th Law – Plea Deals)</p>
        <p>This law discourages the use of plea deals, which can be coercive and undermine justice by pressuring innocent defendants to plead guilty out of fear. By fining prosecutors for offering plea deals, it aims to eliminate their use as tools for psychological intimidation or expediency. While plea deals can save time in certain cases, their potential for abuse—convicting the innocent or obscuring the truth—outweighs their benefits. This measure reinforces the right to a full trial, ensuring convictions are based on evidence, not fear or convenience.</p>

    <h4>(Legal Definitions)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 41. When a set of laws does not provide a definition of a word or phrase, only the definitions found in the three most widely distributed dictionaries may be used in court. Of these definitions, all that are applicable should be used. Most widely distributed is determined by total volume of individual book sales over the last ten years. Individual means no other product is bundled with the dictionary, which excludes all software packages. Sales indicates a financial transaction which is not free has occurred. Total volume refers to the number of people who have purchased the book, not the dollar total or the quantity of books. If a court offers a different definition, a clarification, an interpretation, instructions, or other factors to be considered by the jury that are not in law or one of these dictionaries, then the court shall pay a fine to each juror of one AIPY via FPS and pay a fine to the defendant of 12 AIPY via FPS. Further, the jury is to disregard said comments by the judge.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 41st Law – Legal Definitions)</p>
        <p>This law eliminates ambiguous or unwritten laws by mandating that undefined legal terms rely solely on definitions from the three most widely sold dictionaries. It prevents judges from imposing their own interpretations, which can lead to arbitrary or biased rulings. Fines for non-compliance and instructions for juries to disregard improper judicial comments ensure adherence. By standardizing definitions, this law promotes clarity, fairness, and predictability in legal proceedings, protecting defendants from vague or weaponized laws that undermine constitutional protections.</p>

    <h4>(Gender/Race Equality)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 43. A defendant may contest any consequences such as the amount of jail, fines, or restrictions they receive for a set of charges. At which point, if a defense attorney can find ten cases representing similar conduct within the last ten years where the case had an opposite-gender defendant and, after being adjusted for discrepancies between the conduct of the cases, the defendant’s jail time, fine, or other consequence is to be reduced down to the equivalent of the opposite-gender amount. Factors that may not be considered: trial vs plea deal, age if under 18, gender, race, criminal history. Factors to be considered are: if the defendant provided useful information leading to other convictions, the quantity of acts, severity of acts, violence, cruelty, abuse of authority, significant superior physical power, mental disabilities. A case that has already had its consequence reduced by this law may not be used by this law as one of the ten. If a judge does not re-evaluate the consequence within one month of the submitted petition by the defense attorney, then the judge shall pay a fine of one AIPM via FPS. This law has no retroactive aspect such that convictions that took place prior to the enactment of this law cannot be used.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 43rd Law – Gender/Race Equality)</p>
        <p>This law promotes fairness in sentencing by allowing defendants to challenge penalties that appear disproportionate based on gender. By requiring comparison to ten similar cases involving opposite-gender defendants, it ensures equitable treatment, adjusting for relevant factors like act severity while excluding irrelevant ones like criminal history. The one-month judicial review deadline, enforced by fines, ensures timely action. Transparency in documenting sentencing rationales further supports accountability. This law aims to eliminate gender-based disparities, fostering equal protection under the law and public trust in judicial impartiality.</p>

    <h4>(Free Speech)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 44. Provided nobody suffers direct loss, within the fields of freedom of speech (writing, plays, poetry, comics, drawings, paintings, sculptures, music, dance, modeling, pottery, acrobatics, non-health massages, photography, videography, computer-generated art, computer-generated games, role-playing games, card games, board games, skating, swimming, sunbathing, home or business decor, and speech), if a person is arrested or fined, or a business is fined or prohibited by any government agency based on protected content (religious views, political views, choice of sexuality, grammar, language, intended audience, nudity, inappropriate attire, offensive or inappropriate behavior as content in something such as a book, excluding actual conduct), then the agency shall pay a fine to the person or business of ten times the fine issued and ten AIPY if arrested via FPS. Verbal abuse is not protected content. In circumstances where a person or organization is likely to suffer direct loss regarding the communication of real events and facts, the public communicator may decline to reveal sources of information.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 44th Law – Free Speech)</p>
        <p>This law robustly protects freedom of speech across a wide range of expressive activities, provided no direct harm (e.g., plagiarism, vandalism, or injury) occurs. It penalizes government agencies for arresting or fining individuals or businesses over protected content, such as religious or political views, with substantial fines to deter censorship. The exclusion of verbal abuse and the allowance for communicators to protect sources balance free expression with public safety. By safeguarding diverse forms of speech and art, this law upholds constitutional freedoms and prevents government overreach into personal expression.</p>

    <p>Law of Ryvah 45. If law enforcement arrests a person for being offensive, annoying, or irritating without a formal complaint being filed where a loss has been identified, then the court shall pay a fine to the defendant of one AIPY per charge via FPS.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 45th Law – Annoy)</p>
        <p>This law protects individuals from arbitrary arrests for vague offenses like “annoying” or “offending” without a documented loss, such as disturbing the peace or disrupting a public space. It clarifies that personal discomfort or disagreement with someone’s behavior does not justify legal action unless quantifiable harm is proven. By fining courts for such arrests, it deters abuse of vague laws and reinforces the need for clear, evidence-based charges, safeguarding defendants’ rights to due process and fair treatment.</p>

This includes asking about activities required to obtain the educational degree, license, or certification and excludes employment.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 46th Law – Jury Selection)</p>
        <p>This law prevents judges or prosecutors from excluding jurors based on their education or expertise, which can bias juries against defendants presenting complex or technical defenses. By fining inquiries into jurors’ degrees or certifications, it ensures knowledgeable individuals, better equipped to evaluate evidence, are not systematically removed. This promotes impartial and competent juries, countering tactics that favor showmanship over substance and protecting the defendant’s right to a fair trial by a capable jury.</p>

        <p>(Explanation of 47th Law – Permits)</p>
        <p>This law eliminates financial barriers to obtaining permits, licenses, or certifications by prohibiting government agencies from charging fees.

    <p>Law of Ryvah 48. If a defendant is arrested on a charge which has the criteria of abuse or harm and that act described is not (one with a negative overall impact) and (did not cause any of: loss, humiliation, guilt, condemnation, fear, a loss of self-esteem, slander, or discrediting either the subject or loved one of the subject, intentional damage to highly valued personal property, physical injury to pets, or physical injury), then the court shall pay the defendant a fine of one AIPY via FPS.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 48th Law – Abuse, Harm)</p>
        <p>This law clarifies the definitions of “abuse” and “harm” to prevent overbroad or vague charges that do not reflect actual harm. It requires that such charges involve both a negative overall impact and specific, tangible effects like loss, humiliation, or injury. By fining courts for improper arrests, it protects defendants from unjust accusations, ensuring charges are grounded in clear, measurable harm. This promotes fairness and precision in legal proceedings, safeguarding against abuse of authority.</p>

    <p>Law of Ryvah 49. If any level of determination of guilt less than beyond a reasonable doubt is used in a criminal conviction of a U.S. citizen, then the court is to pay a fine to the defendant of ten AIPY per charge via FPS. Beyond a reasonable doubt requires all scenarios offered by the defense to be proven wrong, preposterous, wholly ridiculous, and beyond any level of doubt which could be considered reasonable. Evidence such as audio/video recordings, ballistics, medical records, DNA, or fingerprints that scientifically disprove defense scenarios, or consistent, untainted verbal testimony meeting strict criteria, can disprove a defense scenario. A defense scenario where evidence is prohibited by the judge is by definition established and cannot be disproved, requiring the only valid verdict to be not guilty.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 49th Law – Beyond Reasonable Doubt)</p>
        <p>This law codifies a stringent definition of “beyond a reasonable doubt,” ensuring convictions require the prosecution to disprove all defense scenarios with robust evidence, such as scientific data or credible testimony meeting five strict criteria (insistent, consistent, persistent, untainted, complete). It protects defendants by fining courts for convictions based on lesser standards and deems prohibited defense evidence as established, mandating a not guilty verdict. This reinforces the high burden of proof on the prosecution, safeguarding against wrongful convictions.</p>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 50th Law – Three Days of Deliberation)</p>
        <p>This law establishes that jury deliberation exceeding three days inherently indicates reasonable doubt, as prolonged discussion suggests unresolved defense scenarios.

    <p>Law of Ryvah 51. When a person is incarcerated for more than five consecutive days and has not been convicted of the crime they are incarcerated for, then insurance, loans, services, and support payments go into hibernation. Hibernation begins retroactively to the date of incarceration and ends when it ends (or a conviction is levied). During hibernation, no interest, fees, or other charges can be levied. The service cannot be discontinued by the provider. The person cannot be evicted. Insurance includes: home, auto, medical, theft, vandalism, and life insurance. It excludes: workers compensation, commercial auto, and business insurance. Loans include: all loans initiated over six months prior to the incarceration whenever the defendant is the only signer, such as a home mortgage, vehicle loan, small business loan, and all credit card debt. For credit card debt, the account must be over six months old, and the date of individual charges is irrelevant. Services include: electric, water, gas, utilities, security, residential home maintenance, online services, memberships, newspapers, and magazines (which must be forwarded to the person’s current address). Support includes: alimony, child support, and court-ordered payments. Nothing else qualifies as support. All hibernation expenses are to be paid by the court. If an organization does not forward invoices to the court, then the organization shall pay a fine to the defendant of one dollar via FPS. If the court does not pay the expenses that are forwarded to it, then those invoices become fines due the defendant via FPS.</p>

Courts cover these expenses, ensuring defendants can return to their lives post-release without financial ruin. Fines for non-compliant organizations or courts enforce accountability.

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 52nd Law – Probation)</p>
        <p>This law aims to eliminate parole, registration, and probation by fining courts weekly for imposing them, arguing they create unequal legal standards for different groups. Such measures often impose restrictive rules that undermine equal protection, particularly for ex-convicts, compared to other citizens.

        <p>(Explanation of 53rd Law – Violence)</p>
        <p>This law defines “violent” strictly to prevent its misuse in describing lesser acts, such as yelling or minor battery, which do not cause significant physical harm. By requiring specific injuries—like bruises over an inch, broken skin, burns, or eye damage—it ensures the term is reserved for serious offenses. Fining courts for misapplication deters exaggerated charges, protecting defendants from inflated accusations while maintaining protections for victims of true violence, thus ensuring fair and precise legal proceedings.</p>

Each email, phone call, chat, text message, transaction, and conversation constitutes a separate subject with privacy. Companies and corporations are not subjects. Public Service Clause: If an organization contractually requires the ability to violate a subject’s privacy, it shall pay a fee of one AIPM via FPS per month while the subject is under contract. If a government or 1,000-strong organization invades a subject’s privacy without a contract, court order, or probable cause, it shall pay a fine of one AIPY via FPS per violation. Type A invasions (by non-service providers) include photographing on private property, recording in private areas, accessing unauthorized accounts, trespassing, or recording communications. Type B invasions (by non-contracted service providers) include similar acts plus misuse of recordings. Type C invasions (by contracted service providers) include accessing unauthorized accounts, misusing identifiable recordings, or analyzing data beyond service provision.</p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 57th Law – Privacy)</p>
        <p>This law robustly protects privacy by defining a “subject” with inherent privacy rights, excluding criminal or emergency contexts. It categorizes invasions by organizations, imposing fines for unauthorized surveillance, recordings, or data misuse, with stricter rules for non-service providers (Type A) and nuanced protections for service providers (Types B and C). A public service clause allows contracted privacy waivers with fees, ensuring transparency. By targeting government and large organizations, it curbs systemic privacy violations, reinforcing constitutional protections against unreasonable searches.</p>

    <h4>(Consent)</h4>
    <p>Law of Ryvah 58. A. If the ability of a conscious individual to grant or deny permission or consent is ignored, and any person is subject to drugs, mutilation, delays, criminal proceedings, or death that could have been avoided by observing consent, then the court shall pay a fine of ten AIPY via FPS. Conscious means awake and of sound mind, excluding those incapacitated by extreme conditions. B. If a government agency administers a drug or chemical causing sedation, apathy, compliance, lethargy, confusion, drunkenness, disorientation, or euphoria without written consent or a specific court order, it shall pay a fine of one AIPY via FPS. Consent requires full disclosure of mental side effects.</p>

        <p>This law upholds the fundamental right to consent, fining courts for ignoring a conscious individual’s permission in matters involving drugs, mutilation, delays, proceedings, or death. Part B specifically prohibits government agencies from administering psychoactive substances without informed consent or a targeted court order, covering vaccines, water additives, and food preservatives. By requiring full disclosure of side effects, it ensures transparency, protecting personal autonomy and preventing government overreach into individual decision-making, a cornerstone of constitutional liberty.</p>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>(Explanation of 59th Law – Privacy of Property)</p>
        <p>This law protects the right to own personal property without mandatory disclosure, fining agencies that penalize non-reporting with the property’s value, ten times the original fine, and an additional AIPY. It prevents governments from using disclosure as a pretext for taxation or seizure, thwarting tyrannical asset grabs. By ensuring privacy in property ownership, it safeguards against unjust deprivation, aligning with constitutional protections and promoting individual security in personal effects.</p>

Each measure ensures defendants can defend themselves without fear of coerced or misused statements, safeguarding confidentiality and fairness. By imposing substantial fines, it deters prosecutorial tactics that undermine the right to remain silent and a fair trial, reinforcing constitutional protections.</p>

B. If a defendant is not given an opportunity to question a witness against him to the defendant’s satisfaction, provided this can be done within six hours, the question does not generate hearsay, does not require the witness to draw a conclusion on a topic they lack sufficient expertise on (a Bachelor’s degree suffices for scientific conclusions), and at least one juror wishes to hear the answer based on potential relevancy, then the court shall pay a fine to the defendant of one AIPY per witness via FPS. If the expenses of defense witnesses (travel, lodging, food, lost income, cancellations) are not paid in full, then the court shall pay the witness one AIPY via FPS and the defendant 10 AIPY via FPS. A request for subpoena must be submitted at least two weeks prior to trial to employ this law.</p>

The validity of all voters must be established to maintain the equality of all voters. The fabrication of fictitious people is one of two primary forms of voting fraud. The second form is vote modification, which will be solved by a self-regulating, reconcilable voting system (SRRVS). If the government agency denies a U.S. citizen over the age of 18 the ability to be validated, registered to vote, six months in advance of an election or vote of the people, then that agency shall pay a fine to that person of one AIPW via FPS.</p>
