PayPal Environment Variables Setup
===================================

Your PayPal configuration has been updated to use environment variables for security.

REQUIRED: Set these environment variables on your server:

PAYPAL_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_ID=your_production_client_id_here
PAYPAL_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_SECRET=your_production_client_secret_here

OPTIONAL (for testing):
PAYPAL_SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_client_id_here
PAYPAL_SANDBOX_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sandbox_client_secret_here

How to set them:
1. Contact your hosting provider for server-level environment variables
2. Or use .htaccess: SetEnv PAYPAL_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_ID "your_value"
3. Or create a .env file and load it in your bootstrap

Changes made to your config:
- Environment: sandbox → production
- Domain: localhost → https://ryvahcommerce.com
- Credentials: hardcoded → environment variables
- Sandbox credentials: commented out (still available)
- SSL bypass: disabled for production security
